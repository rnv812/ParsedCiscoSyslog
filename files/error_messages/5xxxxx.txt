500003

Error Message

%ASA-5-500003: Bad TCP hdr length (hdrlen=bytes , pktlen=bytes ) from
source_address /source_port to dest_address /dest_port , flags: tcp_flags , on
interface interface_name

Explanation

A header length in TCP was incorrect. Some operating systems do not handle TCP
resets (RSTs) correctly when responding to a connection request to a disabled
socket. If a client tries to connect to an FTP server outside the Secure
Firewall ASA and the FTP server is not listening, then it sends an RST. Some
operating systems send incorrect TCP header lengths, which causes this problem.
UDP uses ICMP port unreachable messages.
The TCP header length may indicate that it is larger than the packet length,
which results in a negative number of bytes being transferred. A negative number
appears by a message as an unsigned number, which makes it appear much larger
than it would be normally; for example, it may show 4 GB transferred in one
second. This message should occur infrequently.

Recommended Action

None required.

500004

Error Message

%ASA-4-500004: Invalid transport field for protocol=protocol , from
source_address /source_port to dest_address /dest_port

Explanation

number for a protocol is zero. The protocol value is 6 for TCP and 17 for UDP.

Recommended Action

If these messages persist, contact the administrator of the peer.

500005

Error Message

%ASA-3-500005: connection terminated for protocol from in_ifc_name :src_adddress
/src_port to out_ifc_name :dest_address /dest_port due to invalid combination of
inspections on same flow. Inspect inspect_name is not compatible with filter
filter_name .

Explanation

A connection matched with single or multiple inspection and/or single or
multiple filter features that are not allowed to be applied to the same
connection.

- filter_name - The filter feature name

Recommended Action

Review the class-map, policy-map, service-policy, and/or filter command
configurations that are causing the referenced inspection and/or filter features
that are matched for the connection. The rules for inspection and filter feature
combinations for a connection are as follows:
- The inspect http [http-policy-map] and/or filter url and/or filter java and/or
filter activex commands are valid.
- The inspect ftp [ftp-policy-map] and/or filter ftp commands are valid.
- The filter https command with any other inspect command or filter command is
not valid.
Besides these listed combinations, any other inspection and/or filter feature
combinations are not valid.
