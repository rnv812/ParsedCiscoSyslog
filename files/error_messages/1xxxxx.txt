Reason Code   Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1             The local unit is not receiving the hello packet on the failover
              LAN interface when LAN failover occurs or on the serial failover
              cable when serial failover occurs, and declares that the peer is
              down.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2             An interface did not pass one of the four failover tests, which
              are as follows: 1) Link Up, 2) Monitor for Network Traffic, 3)
              ARP, and 4) Broadcast Ping.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3             No proper ACK for 15+ seconds after a command was sent on the
              serial cable.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4             The failover LAN interface is down, and other data interfaces are
              not responding to additional interface testing. In addition, the
              local unit is declaring that the peer is down.

106001

Error Message

%ASA-2-106001: Inbound TCP connection denied from IP_address/port to
IP_address/port flags tcp_flags on interface interface_name

Explanation

An attempt was made to connect to an inside address is denied by the security
policy that is defined for the specified traffic type. The IP address displayed
is the real IP address instead of the IP address that appears through NAT.
Possible tcp_flags values correspond to the flags in the TCP header that were
present when the connection was denied. For example, a TCP packet arrived for
which no connection state exists in the Secure Firewall ASA, and it was dropped.
The tcp_flags in this packet are FIN and ACK. The tcp_flags are as follows:
- ACK - The acknowledgment number was received
- FIN - Data was sent
- PSH - The receiver passed data to the application
- RST - The connection was reset
- SYN - Sequence numbers were synchronized to start a connection
- URG - The urgent pointer was declared valid

Recommended Action

None required.

106002

Error Message

%ASA-2-106002: protocol Connection denied by outbound list acl_ID src

Explanation

The specified connection failed because of an outbound deny command. The
protocol variable can be ICMP, TCP, or UDP.

Recommended Action

Use the show outbound command to check outbound lists.

106006

Error Message

%ASA-2-106006: Deny inbound UDP from outside_address/outside_port to
inside_address/inside_port on interface interface_name.

Explanation

An inbound UDP packet was denied by the security policy that is defined for the
specified traffic type.

Recommended Action

None required.

106007

Error Message

%ASA-2-106007: Deny inbound UDP from outside_address/outside_port to
inside_address/inside_port due to DNS {Response|Query}.

Explanation

A UDP packet containing a DNS query or response was denied.

Recommended Action

If the inside port number is 53, the inside host probably is set up as a caching
name server. Add an access-list command statement to permit traffic on UDP port
53 and a translation entry for the inside host. If the outside port number is
53, a DNS server was probably too slow to respond, and the query was answered by
another server.

106010

Error Message

%ASA-3-106010: Deny inbound protocol src [interface_name :
source_address/source_port ] [([idfw_user | FQDN_string ], sg_info )] dst
[interface_name : dest_address /dest_port }[([idfw_user | FQDN_string ], sg_info
)]

Explanation

An inbound connection was denied by your security policy.

Recommended Action

Modify the security policy if traffic should be permitted. If the message occurs
at regular intervals, contact the remote peer administrator.

106011

Error Message

%ASA-3-106011: Deny inbound (No xlate) protocol src Interface:IP/port dst
Interface-nameif:IP/port

Explanation

The message appears under normal traffic conditions if there are internal users
that are accessing the Internet through a web browser. Any time a connection is
reset, when the host at the end of the connection sends a packet after the
Secure Firewall ASA receives the connection reset, this message appears. It can
typically be ignored.

Recommended Action

Prevent this message from getting logged to the syslog server by entering the no
logging message 106011 command.

106012

Error Message

%ASA-6-106012: Deny IP from IP_address to IP_address , IP options hex.

Explanation

An IP packet was seen with IP options. Because IP options are considered a
security risk, the packet was discarded.

Recommended Action

Contact the remote host system administrator to determine the problem. Check the
local site for loose source routing or strict source routing.

106013

Error Message

%ASA-2-106013: Dropping echo request from IP_address to PAT address IP_address

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA discarded an inbound ICMP Echo Request packet with a
destination address that corresponds to a PAT global address. The inbound packet
is discarded because it cannot specify which PAT host should receive the packet.

Recommended Action

None required.

106014

Error Message

%ASA-3-106014: Deny inbound icmp src interface_name : IP_address [([idfw_user |
FQDN_string ], sg_info )] dst interface_name : IP_address [([idfw_user |
FQDN_string ], sg_info )] (type dec , code dec )

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA denied any inbound ICMP packet access. By default, all
ICMP packets are denied access unless specifically allowed.

Recommended Action

None required.

106015

Error Message

%ASA-6-106015: Deny TCP (no connection) from IP_address /port to IP_address
/port flags tcp_flags on interface interface_name.

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA discarded a TCP packet that has no associated connection
in the Secure Firewall ASA connection table. The Secure Firewall ASA looks for a
SYN flag in the packet, which indicates a request to establish a new connection.
If the SYN flag is not set, and there is no existing connection, the Secure
Firewall ASA discards the packet.

Recommended Action

None required unless the Secure Firewall ASA receives a large volume of these
invalid TCP packets. If this is the case, trace the packets to the source and
determine the reason these packets were sent.

106016

Error Message

%ASA-2-106016: Deny IP spoof from (IP_address ) to IP_address on interface
interface_name.

Explanation

A packet arrived at the Secure Firewall ASA interface that has a destination IP
address of 0.0.0.0 and a destination MAC address of the Secure Firewall ASA
interface. In addition, this message is generated when the Secure Firewall ASA
discarded a packet with an invalid source address, which may include one of the
following or some other invalid address:
- Loopback network (127.0.0.0)
- Broadcast (limited, net-directed, subnet-directed, and all-subnets-directed)
- The destination host (land.c)
To further enhance spoof packet detection, use the icmp command to configure the
Secure Firewall ASA to discard packets with source addresses belonging to the
internal network, because the access-list command has been deprecated and is no
longer guaranteed to work correctly.

Recommended Action

Determine if an external user is trying to compromise the protected network.
Check for misconfigured clients.

106017

Error Message

%ASA-2-106017: Deny IP due to Land Attack from IP_address to IP_address

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA received a packet with the IP source address equal to
the IP destination, and the destination port equal to the source port. This
message indicates a spoofed packet that is designed to attack systems. This
attack is referred to as a Land Attack.

Recommended Action

If this message persists, an attack may be in progress. The packet does not
provide enough information to determine where the attack originates.

106018

Error Message

%ASA-2-106018: ICMP packet type ICMP_type denied by outbound list acl_ID src
inside_address dest outside_address

Explanation

The outgoing ICMP packet with the specified ICMP from local host
(inside_address) to the foreign host (outside_address) was denied by the
outbound ACL list.

Recommended Action

None required.

106020

Error Message

%ASA-2-106020: Deny IP teardrop fragment (size = number, offset = number) from
IP_address to IP_address

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA discarded an IP packet with a teardrop signature
containing either a small offset or fragment overlapping. This is a hostile
event that circumvents the Secure Firewall ASA or an Intrusion Detection System.

Recommended Action

Contact the remote peer administrator or escalate this issue according to your
security policy.

106021

Error Message

%ASA-1-106021: Deny protocol reverse path check from source_address to
dest_address on interface interface_name

Explanation

An attack is in progress. Someone is attempting to spoof an IP address on an
inbound connection. Unicast RPF, also known as reverse route lookup, detected a
packet that does not have a source address represented by a route and assumes
that it is part of an attack on your Secure Firewall ASA. This message appears
when you have enabled Unicast RPF with the ip verify reverse-path command. This
feature works on packets input to an interface; if it is configured on the
outside, then the Secure Firewall ASA checks packets arriving from the outside.
The Secure Firewall ASA looks up a route based on the source_address. If an
entry is not found and a route is not defined, then this message appears and the
connection is dropped. If there is a route, the Secure Firewall ASA checks which
interface it corresponds to. If the packet arrived on another interface, it is
either a spoof or there is an asymmetric routing environment that has more than
one path to a destination. The Secure Firewall ASA does not support asymmetric
routing. If the Secure Firewall ASA is configured on an internal interface, it
checks static route command statements or RIP, and if the source_address is not
found, then an internal user is spoofing their address.

Recommended Action

Even though an attack is in progress, if this feature is enabled, no user action
is required. The Secure Firewall ASA repels the attack.

106022

Error Message

%ASA-1-106022: Deny protocol connection spoof from source_address to
dest_address on interface interface_name

Explanation

A packet matching a connection arrived on a different interface from the
interface on which the connection began. In addition, the ip verify reverse-path
command is not configured. For example, if a user starts a connection on the
inside interface, but the Secure Firewall ASA detects the same connection
arriving on a perimeter interface, the Secure Firewall ASA has more than one
path to a destination. This is known as asymmetric routing and is not supported
on the Secure Firewall ASA. An attacker also might be attempting to append
packets from one connection to another as a way to break into the Secure
Firewall ASA. In either case, the Secure Firewall ASA shows this message and
drops the connection.

Recommended Action

Check that the routing is not asymmetric.

106023

Error Message

%ASA-4-106023: Deny protocol src [interface_name :source_address /source_port ]
[([idfw_user |FQDN_string ], sg_info )] dst interface_name :dest_address
/dest_port [([idfw_user |FQDN_string ], sg_info )] [type {string }, code {code
}] by access_group acl_ID [0x8ed66b60, 0xf8852875]

Explanation

A real IP packet was denied by the ACL. This message appears even if you do not
have the log option enabled for an ACL. The IP address is the real IP address
instead of the values that display through NAT. Both user identity information
and FQDN information is provided for the IP addresses if a matched one is found.
The Secure Firewall ASA logs either identity information (domain\user) or FQDN
(if the username is not available). If the identity information or FQDN is
available, the Secure Firewall ASA logs this information for both the source and
destination.

Recommended Action

If messages persist from the same source address, a footprinting or port
scanning attempt might be occurring. Contact the remote host administrator.

106024

Error Message

%ASA-2-106024: Access rules memory exhausted

Explanation

The access list compilation process has run out of memory. All configuration
information that has been added since the last successful access list was
removed from the Secure Firewall ASA, and the most recently compiled set of
access lists will continue to be used.

Recommended Action

Access lists, AAA, ICMP, SSH, Telnet, and other rule types are stored and
compiled as access list rule types. Remove some of these rule types so that
others can be added.

106025, 106026

Error Message

%ASA-6-106025: Failed to determine the security context for the

Error Message

%ASA-6-106026: Failed to determine the security context for the
packet:sourceVlan:source_address dest_address source_port dest_port protocol

Explanation

The security context of the packet in multiple context mode cannot be
determined. Both messages can be generated for IP packets being dropped in
either router and transparent mode.

Recommended Action

None required.

106027

Error Message

%ASA-4-106027:acl_ID: Deny src [source address] dst [destination address] by
access-group “access-list name"

Explanation

An non IP packet was denied by the ACL. This message is displayed even if you do
not have the log option enabled for an extended ACL.

Recommended Action

If messages persist from the same source address, it might indicate a
foot-printing or port-scanning attempt. Contact the remote host administrator.

106100

Error Message

%ASA-6-106100: access-list acl_ID {permitted | denied | est-allowed} protocol
interface_name /source_address (source_port ) (idfw_user , sg_info )
interface_name /dest_address (dest_port ) (idfw_user , sg_info ) hit-cnt number
({first hit | number -second interval}) hash codes

Explanation

The initial occurrence or the total number of occurrences during an interval are
listed. This message provides more information than message 106023, which only
logs denied packets, and does not include the hit count or a configurable level.
When an access-list line has the log argument, it is expected that this message
ID might be triggered because of a nonsynchronized packet reaching the Secure
Firewall ASA and being evaluated by the access list. For example, if an ACK
packet is received on the Secure Firewall ASA (for which no TCP connection
exists in the connection table), the Secure Firewall ASA might generate message
106100, indicating that the packet was permitted; however, the packet is later
correctly dropped because of no matching connection. The following list
describes the message values:
- permitted | denied | est-allowed-These values specify if the packet was
permitted or denied by the ACL. If the value is est-allowed, the packet was
denied by the ACL but was allowed for an already established session (for
example, an internal user is allowed to accesss the Internet, and responding
packets that would normally be denied by the ACL are accepted).
- protocol -TCP, UDP, ICMP, or an IP protocol number.
- interface_name -The interface name for the source or destination of the logged
flow. The VLAN interfaces are supported.
- source_address -The source IP address of the logged flow. The IP address is
the real IP address instead of the values that display through NAT.
- dest_address -The destination IP address of the logged flow. The IP address is
the real IP address instead of the values that display through NAT.
- source_port -The source port of the logged flow (TCP or UDP). For ICMP, the
number after the source port is the message type.
- idfw_user- The user identity username, including the domain name that is added
to the existing syslog when the Secure Firewall ASA can find the username for
the IP address.
- sg_info- The security group tag that is added to the syslog when the Secure
Firewall ASA can find a security group tag for the IP address. The security
group name is displayed with the security group tag, if available.
- dest_port -The destination port of the logged flow (TCP or UDP). For ICMP, the
number after the destination port is the ICMP message code, which is available
for some message types. For type 8, it is always 0. For a list of ICMP message
types, see the following URL:
http://www.iana.org/assignments/icmp-parameters/icmp-parameters.xml.
- hit-cnt number -The number of times this flow was permitted or denied by this
ACL entry in the configured time interval. The value is 1 when the Secure
Firewall ASA generates the first message for this flow.
- first hit-The first message generated for this flow.
- number -second interval-The interval in which the hit count is accumulated.
Set this interval using the access-list command with the interval option.
- hash codes-Two are always printed for the object group ACE and the constituent
regular ACE. Values are determined on which ACE that the packet hit. To display
these hash codes, enter the show-access list command.

Recommended Action

None required.

Explanation

If you configured the log option for an ACL deny statement (access-list id deny
command), and a traffic flow matches the ACL statement, the Secure Firewall ASA
caches the flow information. This message indicates that the number of matching
flows that are cached on the Secure Firewall ASA exceeds the user-configured
limit (using the access-list deny-flow-max command). This message might be
generated as a result of a DoS attack.
- number - The limit configured using the access-list deny-flow-max command

Recommended Action

None required.

interface:source_address/source_port to egress_interface:dest_address/dest_port

Explanation

AAA is being bypassed for same security traffic that matches a configured AAA
rule. This can only occur when traffic passes between two interfaces that have
the same configured security level, when the same security traffic is permitted,
and if the AAA configuration uses the include or exclude syntax.

Recommended Action

None required.

109029

Error Message

%ASA-5-109029: Parsing downloaded ACL: string

Explanation

A syntax error occurred while parsing an access list that was downloaded from a
RADIUS server during user authentication.
- string - An error message detailing the syntax error that prevented the access
list from parsing correctly

Recommended Action

Use the information presented in this message to identify and correct the syntax
error in the access list definition within the RADIUS server configuration.

109030

Error Message

%ASA-4-109030: Autodetect ACL convert wildcard did not convert ACL access_list
source |dest netmask netmask .

Explanation

A dynamic ACL that is configured on a RADIUS server is not converted by the
mechanism for automatically detecting wildcard netmasks. The problem occurs
because this mechanism cannot determine if the netmask is a wildcard or a normal
netmask.
- access_list - The access list that cannot be converted
- source - The source IP address
- dest - The destination IP address
- netmask - The subnet mask for the destination or source address in
dotted-decimal notation

Recommended Action

Check the access list netmask on the RADIUS server for the wildcard
configuration. If the netmask is supposed to be a wildcard, and if all access
list netmasks on that server are wildcards, then use the wildcard setting for
acl-netmask-convert for the AAA server. Otherwise, change the netmask to a
normal netmask or to a wildcard netmask that does not contain holes (that is,
where the netmask presents consecutive binary 1s. For example,
00000000.00000000.00011111.11111111 or hex 0.0.31.255). If the mask is supposed
to be normal and all access list netmasks on that server are normal, then use
the normal setting for acl-netmask-convert for the AAA server.

109031

Error Message

%ASA-4-109031: NT Domain Authentication Failed: rejecting guest login for
username .

Explanation

A user has tried to authenticate to an NT domain that was configured for guest
account access and the username is not a valid username on the NT server. The
connection is denied.

Recommended Action

If the user is a valid user, add an account to the NT server. If the user is not
allowed access, no action is required.

109032

Error Message

%ASA-3-109032: Unable to install ACL access_list , downloaded for user username
; Error in ACE: ace .

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA received an access control list from a RADIUS server to
apply to a user connection, but an entry in the list contains a syntax error. Th
euse of a list containing an error could result in the violation of a security
policy, so the Secure Firewall ASA failed to authenticate the user.
- access_list - The name assigned to the dynamic access list as it would appear
in the output of the show access-list command
- username - The name of the user whose connection will be subject to this
access list
- ace - The access list entry that was being processed when the error was
detected

Recommended Action

Correct the access list definition in the RADIUS server configuration.

109033

Error Message

%ASA-4-109033: Authentication failed for admin user user from src_IP .
Interactive challenge processing is not supported for protocol connections

Explanation

AAA challenge processing was triggered during authentication of an
administrative connection, but the Secure Firewall ASA cannot initiate
interactive challenge processing with the client application. When this occurs,
the authentication attempt will be rejected and the connection denied.
- user - The name of the user being authenticated
- src_IP - The IP address of the client host
- protocol - The client connection protocol (SSH v1 or administrative HTTP)

Recommended Action

Reconfigure AAA so that challenge processing does not occur for these connection
types. This generally means to avoid authenticating these connection types to
RSA SecurID servers or to any token-based AAA server via RADIUS.

109034

Error Message

%ASA-4-109034: Authentication failed for network user user from src_IP/port to
dst_IP/port . Interactive challenge processing is not supported for protocol
connections

Explanation

AAA challenge processing was triggered during authentication of a network
connection, but the Secure Firewall ASA cannot initiate interactive challenge
processing with the client application. When this occurs, the authentication
attempt will be rejected and the connection denied.
- user - The name of the user being authenticated
- src_IP/port - The IP address and port of the client host
- dst_IP/port - The IP address and port of the server to which the client is
attempting to connect
- protocol - The client connection protocol (for example, FTP)

Recommended Action

Reconfigure AAA so that challenge processing does not occur for these connection
types. This generally means to avoid authenticating these connection types to
RSA SecurID servers or to any token-based AAA server via RADIUS.

109035

Error Message

%ASA-3-109035: Exceeded maximum number (<max_num>) of DAP attribute instances
for user <user>

Explanation

This log is generated when the number of DAP attributes received from the RADIUS
server exceeds the maximum number allowed when authenticating a connection for
the specified user.

Recommended Action

Modify the DAP attribute configuration to reduce the number of DAP attributes
below the maximum number allowed as specified in the log so that the specified
user can connect.

109036

Error Message

%ASA-6-109036: Exceeded 1000 attribute values for the attribute name attribute
for user username .

Explanation

The LDAP response message contains an attribute that has more than 1000 values.
- attribute_name - The LDAP attribute name
- username - The username at login

Recommended Action

None required.

109037

Error Message

%ASA-3-109037: Exceeded 5000 attribute values for the attribute name attribute
for user username .

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA supports multiple values of the same attribute received
from a AAA server. If the AAA server sends a response containing more than 5000
values for the same attribute, then the Secure Firewall ASA treats this response
message as being malformed and rejects the authentication. This condition has
only been seen in lab environments using specialized test tools. It is unlikely
that the condition would occur in a real-world production network.
- attribute_name - The LDAP attribute name
- username - The username at login

Recommended Action

Capture the authentication traffic between the Secure Firewall ASA and AAA
server using a protocol sniffer (such as WireShark), then forward the trace file
to the Cisco TAC for analysis.

109038

Error Message

%ASA-3-109038: Attribute internal-attribute-name value string-from-server from
AAA server could not be parsed as a type internal-attribute-name string
representation of the attribute name

Explanation

The AAA subsystem tried to parse an attribute from the AAA server into an
internal representation and failed.
- string-from-server - String received from the AAA server, truncated to 40
characters.
- type - The type of the specified attribute

Recommended Action

Verify that the attribute is being generated correctly on the AAA server. For
additional information, use the debug ldap and debug radius commands.

109039

Error Message

%ASA-5-109039: AAA Authentication:Dropping an unsupported IPv6/IP46/IP64 packet
from lifc :laddr to fifc :faddr

Explanation

A packet containing IPv6 addresses or IPv4 addresses translated to IPv6
addresses by NAT requires AAA authentication or authorization. AAA
authentication and authorization do not support IPv6 addresses. The packet is
dropped.
- lifc - The ingress interface
- laddr - The source IP address
- fifc - The egress interface
- faddr - The destination IP address after NAT translation, if any

Recommended Action

None required.

109040

Error Message

%ASA-4-109040: User at IP exceeded auth proxy rate limit of 10 connections/sec

Explanation

A connection attempt has been rejected because the ASA has detected a high
frequency of HTTPS authentication requests from the same host.
- IP - The IP address of the host from which the connection was initiated

Recommended Action

Limit the number of cut-through proxy authentication attempts from users.

109105

Error Message

%ASA-3-109105: Failed to determine the egress interface for locally generated
traffic destined to <protocol> <IP>:<port>.

Explanation

It is necessary for Secure Firewall ASA to log a syslog if no routes are present
when the interface is BVI. Apparently, if default route is present and it does
not route packet to the correct interface then it becomes impossible to track
it.

Recommended Action

It is highly recommended to add default route for correct destination or add
static routes.
