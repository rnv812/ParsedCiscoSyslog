602103

Error Message

%ASA-6-602103: IPSEC: Received an ICMP Destination Unreachable from src_addr
with suggested PMTU of rcvd_mtu; PMTU updated for SA with peer peer_addr, SPI
spi, tunnel name username, old PMTU old_mtu, new PMTU new_mtu.

Explanation

The MTU of an SA was changed. When a packet is received for an IPsec tunnel, the
corresponding SA is located and the MTU is updated based on the MTU suggested in
the ICMP packet. If the suggested MTU is greater than 0 but less than 256, then
the new MTU is set to 256. If the suggested MTU is 0, the old MTU is reduced by
256 or it is set to 256 - whichever value is greater. If the suggested MTU is
greater than 256, then the new MTU is set to the suggested value.
- src_addr - IP address of the PMTU sender
- rcvd_mtu - Suggested MTU received in the PMTU message
- peer_addr - IP address of the IPsec peer
- spi - IPsec Security Parameter Index
- username - Username associated with the IPsec tunnel

PMTU is unchanged because suggested PMTU of rcvd_mtu is equal to or greater than
the current PMTU of curr_mtu , for SA with peer peer_addr , SPI spi , tunnel
name username .

Explanation

An ICMP message was received indicating that a packet sent over an IPsec tunnel
exceeded the path MTU, and the suggested MTU was greater than or equal to the
current MTU. Because the MTU value is already correct, no MTU adjustment is
made. This may happen when multiple PMTU messages are received from different
intermediate stations, and the MTU is adjusted before the current PMTU message
is processed.
- src_addr - IP address of the PMTU sender
- rcvd_mtu - Suggested MTU received in the PMTU message
- curr_mtu - Current MTU associated with the IPsec tunnel

Error Message

%ASA-6-611312: VPNClient: Backup Server List: reason

Explanation

When the Secure Firewall ASA is an Easy VPN remote device, the Easy VPN server
downloaded a list of backup servers to the Secure Firewall ASA. This list
overrides any backup servers that you have configured locally. If the downloaded
list is empty, then the Secure Firewall ASA uses no backup servers. The reason
is one of the following messages:
- A list of backup server IP addresses
- Received NULL list. Deleting current backup servers

Recommended Action

None required.

611313

Error Message

%ASA-3-611313: VPNClient: Backup Server List Error: reason

Explanation

When the Secure Firewall ASA is an Easy VPN remote device, and the Easy VPN
server downloads a backup server list to the Secure Firewall ASA, the list
includes an invalid IP address or a hostname. The Secure Firewall ASA does not
support DNS, and therefore does not support hostnames for servers, unless you
manually map a name to an IP address using the name command.

Recommended Action

On the Easy VPN server, make sure that the server IP addresses are correct, and
configure the servers as IP addresses instead of hostnames. If you must use
hostnames on the server, use the name command on the Easy VPN remote device to
map the IP addresses to names.

613015

Error Message

%ASA-4-613015: Process 1 flushes LSA ID IP_address type-number adv-rtr
IP_address in area mask

Explanation

A router is extensively re-originating or flushing the LSA reported by this
error message.

Recommended Action

If this router is flushing the network LSA, it means the router received a
network LSA whose LSA ID conflicts with the IP address of one of the router's
interfaces and flushed the LSA out of the network. For OSPF to function
correctly, the IP addresses of transit networks must be unique. Conflicting
routers are the router reporting this error message and the router with the OSPF
router ID reported as adv-rtr in this message. If this router is re-originating
an LSA, it is highly probable that some other router is flushing this LSA out of
the network. Find that router and avoid the conflict. The conflict for a Type-2
LSA may be due to a duplicate LSA ID. For a Type-5 LSA, it may be a duplicate
router ID on the router reporting this error message and on the routers
connected to a different area. In an unstable network, this message may also
warn of extensive re-origination of the LSA for some other reason. Contact Cisco
TAC to investigate this type of case.

613016

Error Message

%ASA-3-613016: Area string router-LSA of length number bytes plus update
overhead bytes is too large to flood.

Explanation

The router tried to build a router-LSA that is larger than the huge system
buffer size or the OSPF protocol imposed maximum.

Recommended Action

If the reported total length (LSA size plus overhead) is larger than the huge
system buffer size but less than 65535 bytes (the OSPF protocol imposed
maximum), you may increase the huge system buffer size. If the reported total
length is greater than 65535, you need to decrease the number of OSPF interfaces
in the reported area.

613017

Error Message

620002

Error Message

%ASA-4-620002: Unsupported CTIQBE version: hex: from interface_name :IP_address
/port to interface_name :IP_address /port

Explanation

The ASA received a CTIQBE message with an unsupported version number, and
dropped the packet. This message is rate limited to one message every 10
seconds.

Recommended Action

If the version number captured in the log message is unreasonably large (greater
than 10), the packet may be malformed, a non-CTIQBE packet, or corrupted before
it arrives at the ASA. We recommend that you determine the source of the
packets. If the version number is reasonably small (less than or equal to 10),
then contact the Cisco TAC to see if a new ASA image that supports this CTIQBE
version is available.
