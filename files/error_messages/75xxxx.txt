Recommended Action

Review the syslog and follow the flow of the logs to determine if this syslog is
the final in the exchange and if it is the cause of a potential failure or a
transient error that was renegotiated through. For example, a peer may suggest a
DH group via the KE payload that is not configured that causes an initial
request to fail, but the correct DH group is communicated so that the peer can
come back with the correct group in a new request.

Error Message

%ASA-5-750010: Local: local-ip Remote: remote-ip Username:username IKEv2 local
throttle-request queue depth threshold of threshold reached; increase the window
size on peer peer for better performance

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA overflowed its throttle request queue to the specified
peer, indicating that the peer is slow. The throttle request queue holds
requests destined for the peer, which cannot be sent immediately because the
maximum number of requests allowed to be in-flight based on the IKEv2 window
size were already in-flight. As in-flight requests are completed, requests are
pulled off of the throttle request queue and sent to the peer. If the peer is
not processing these requests quickly, the throttle queue backs up.

- remote-ip - Remote peer IP address
- username - Username of the requester for remote access or tunnel group name
for L2L, if known yet
- threshold - Queue depth threshold of the local throttle-request queue reached
- peer - Remote peer IP address

Recommended Action

If possible, increase the IKEv2 window size on the remote peer to allow more
concurrent requests to be in-flight, which may improve performance.
Note: The Secure Firewall ASA does not currently support an increased IKEv2 window size setting.

of the IPsec child SA encryption algorithm.

750012

Error Message

%ASA-4-750012: Selected IKEv2 encryption algorithm (IKEV2 encry algo ) is not
strong enough to secure proposed IPSEC encryption algorithm (IPSEC encry algo ).

Explanation

Explanation

The new mobike feature allows peer IP to be changed without tearing down the
tunnel. For example, a mobile device (smartphone) acquires new IP after
connecting to a different network.The following list describes the message
values:
- ip - Specifies the previous, the new local, and remote IP addresses
- port - Specifies the previous, the new local, and remote port information
- SPI - Indicates the Initiator and Responder SPI
- iSPI - Specifies the Initiator SPI
- rSPI - Specifies the Responder SPI

750014

Error Message

%ASA-4-750014: Local:<self ip>:<self port> Remote:<peer ip>:<peer port>
Username:<TG or Username> IKEv2 Session aborted. Reason: Initial Contact
received for Local ID: <self ID>, Remote ID: <peer ID> from remote peer:<peer
ip>:<peer port> to <self ip>:<self port>

Explanation

For ASA IKEv2, the initial contact (IC) processing is done based on peer IP/Port
and ASA IP/Port pairs and the stale sessions get deleted based on these IP/Port
pairs. This could be a problem with NAT as IP/Port of peer may change for
connections and the stale sessions would not get cleaned up based on IP/Port
pairs. As per the IKEv2 RFC , the Initial Contact processing will be switched to
use Identity pairs so that the stale sessions can be identified based on peer
and ASA identities and clear them. The identities can be IPs, hostnames,
Certificate DNs, and so on. This syslog displays the exact reason for clearing
the stale sessions. This syslog will be generated on ASA after clearing a stale
session from a peer while negotiating a new IKEv2 session with the same peer.
This syslog is applicable only for standalone and clustering site-to-site VPNs
and not for RA.

Recommended Action

IKEv2 session Initial Contact processing is done to reset state between peers
and clear the stale sessions. If sessions are getting cleared unexpectedly due
to Initial Contact processing, ensure that all peers are configured with unique
identities.

750015

Error Message

%ASA-4-750015: Local:<self ip>:<self port> Remote:<peer ip>:<peer port>
Username:<TG or Username> IKEv2 deleting IPSec SA. Reason: invalid SPI
notification received for SPI 0x<SPI>; local traffic selector = Address Range:
<start address>-<end address> Protocol: <protocol number> Port Range: <start
port>-<end port> ; remote traffic selector = Address Range: <start address>-<end
address> Protocol: <protocol number> Port Range: <start port>-<end port>

Explanation

When an ESP packet gets dropped due to invalid SPI, an INFORMATIONAL exchange
with the peer has been added. When peer receives this notification, the child SA
causing INVALID_SPI scenario will be cleared, thereby sync the child SAs sooner
and reducing the traffic loss. This IKEv2 syslog is introduced when the child SA
gets cleared due to INVALID_SPI INFORMATIONAL exchange. The following describes
the message values:
- SPI - SPI in hex for which INVALID_SPI notification was received.

Recommended Action

An out-of-sync IKEv2 child condition was detected and handled. No action is
required.
