Neither the primary nor backup ScanSafe server is reachable. Based on the
configured default action( fail_close or fail_open), traffic is getting dropped
or sent to the web server without being redirected.

Recommended Action

If both the ScanSafe servers are not reachable, you can change the ScanSafe
configuration to fail_open to send traffic to the web server without having it
redirected to the ScanSafe server. This configuration changes the default action
to permit.

An error was encountered in updating the policies. Policy enforcement will
continue based on old tag values and is no longer accurate.
- sgname - Security group name that has a change in tag value
- sgt - New security group tag value

Recommended Action

To reflect the correct tag value, remove all policies referencing the security
group name and reapply them. If the error persists, contact the Cisco TAC for
assistance.

ifc-name :(IP-address/port) to ifc-name :(IP-address/port) in FP.

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA Fast Path sees a VXLAN packet with an invalid segment
ID.

Recommended Action

Check the VNI interface segment ID configurations to see if the dropped packet
has the VXLAN segment ID that does not match any VNI segment ID configuration.
