Error Message

%ASA-7-710005: {TCP|UDP|SCTP} request discarded from source_address /source_port
to interface_name :dest_address /service

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA does not have a UDP server that services the UDP
request. Also, a TCP packet that does not belong to any session on the Secure
Firewall ASA may have been discarded. In addition, this message appears (with
the SNMP service) when the Secure Firewall ASA receives an SNMP request with an
empty payload, even if it is from an authorized host. When the service is SNMP,
this message occurs a maximum of once every 10 seconds so that the log receiver
is not overwhelmed. This message is also applicable for SCTP packets.

Recommended Action

In networks that use broadcasting services such as DHCP, RIP, or NetBIOS
extensively, the frequency of this message can be high. If this message appears
in excessive numbers, it may indicate an attack.

710006

Error Message

%ASA-7-710006: protocol request discarded from source_address to interface_name
:dest_address

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA does not have an IP server that services the IP protocol
request; for example, the Secure Firewall ASA receives IP packets that are not
TCP or UDP, and the Secure Firewall ASA cannot service the request.

Recommended Action

In networks that use broadcasting services such as DHCP, RIP, or NetBIOS
extensively, the frequency of this message can be high. If this message appears
in excessive numbers, it may indicate an attack.

debug further and diagnose the problem.

713006

Error Message

%ASA-5-713006: Failed to obtain state for message Id message_number , Peer
Address: IP_address

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA does not know about the received message ID. The message
ID is used to identify a specific IKE Phase 2 negotiation. An error condition on
the Secure Firewall ASA may have occurred, and may indicate that the two IKE
peers are out-of-sync.

Recommended Action

None required.

713008

Error Message

%ASA-3-713008: Key ID in ID payload too big for pre-shared IKE tunnel

Explanation

A key ID value was received in the ID payload, which was longer than the maximum
allowed size of a group name for this IKE session using preshared keys
authentication. This is an invalid value, and the session is rejected. Note that
the key ID specified would never work because a group name of that size cannot
be created in the Secure Firewall ASA.

Recommended Action

Make sure that the client peer (most likely an Altiga remote access client)
specifies a valid group name. Notify the user to change the incorrect group name
on the client. The current maximum length for a group name is 32 characters.

713009

Error Message

%ASA-3-713009: OU in DN in ID payload too big for Certs IKE tunnel

Explanation

An OU value in the DN was received in the ID payload, which was longer than the
maximum allowed size of a group name for this IKE session using Certs
authentication. This OU is skipped, and another OU or other criteria may find a
matching group.

Recommended Action

For the client to be able to use an OU to find a group in the Secure Firewall
ASA, the group name must be a valid length. The current maximum length of a
group name is 32 characters.

713010

Error Message

%ASA-5-713010: IKE area: failed to find centry for message Id message_number An
attempt was made to locate a conn_entry (IKE phase 2 structure that corresponds
to an IPsec SA) using the unique message ID, which failed. The internal
structure was not found, which may occur if a session was terminated in a
nonstandard way, but it is more likely that an internal error occurred. If this
problem persists, investigate the peer.

Error Message

%ASA-3-713042: IKE Initiator unable to find policy: Intf interface_number , Src:
source_address , Dst: dest_address

Explanation

The IPsec fast path processed a packet that triggered IKE, but the IKE policy
lookup failed. This error may be timing related. The ACLs that triggered IKE
might have been deleted before IKE processed the initiation request. This
problem will most likely correct itself.

Recommended Action

If the condition persists, check the L2L configuration, paying special attention
to the type of ACL associated with crypto maps.

713043

Explanation

The IPsec SA was not found.

Recommended Action

If this is a remote access tunnel, check the group and user configuration, and
verify that a tunnel group and group policy have been configured for the
specific user group. For externally authenticated users and groups, check the
returned authentication attributes.

713060

Error Message

%ASA-3-713060: Tunnel Rejected: User (user ) not member of group (group_name ),
group-lock check failed.

Explanation

The user is configured for a different group than what was sent in the IPsec
negotiation.

Recommended Action

If you are using the Cisco VPN client and preshared keys, make sure that the
group configured on the client is the same as the group associated with the user
on the Secure Firewall ASA. If you are using digital certificates, the group is
dictated either by the OU field of the certificate, or the user automatically
defaults to the remote access default group.

713061

Error Message

%ASA-3-713061: Tunnel rejected: Crypto Map Policy not found for

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA was not able to find security policy information for the
private networks or hosts indicated in the message. These networks or hosts were
sent by the initiator and do not match any crypto ACLs at the Secure Firewall
ASA. This is most likely a misconfiguration.

Recommended Action

Check the protected network configuration in the crypto ACLs on both sides and
make sure that the local net on the initiator is the remote net on the responder
and vice-versa. Pay special attention to wildcard masks, and host addresses
versus network addresses. Non-Cisco implementations may have the private
addresses labeled as proxy addresses or red networks.

713062

Method (Auth method (auth numerical value))

Explanation

A certificate payload was received, but our internal certificate handle
indicates that we do not have an identity certificate. The certificate handle
was not obtained through a normal enrollment method. One likely reason this can
happen is that the authentication method is not made through RSA or DSS
signatures, although the IKE SA negotiation should fail if each side is
misconfigured.

Recommended Action

Check the trustpoint and ISAKMP configuration settings on the Secure Firewall
ASA and its peer.

713088

%ASA-7-713113: Deleting IKE SA with associated IPsec connection entries. IKE
peer: IP_address , SA address: internal_SA_address , tunnel count: count

Explanation

An IKE SA is being deleted with a nonzero tunnel count, which means that either
the IKE SA tunnel count has lost synchronization with the associated connection
entries or the associated connection cookie fields for the entries have lost
synchronization with the cookie fields of the IKE SA to which the connection
entry points. If this occurs, the IKE SA and its associated data structures will
not be freed, so that the entries that may point to it will not have a stale
pointer.

Recommended Action

None required. Error recovery is built-in.

An internal software error has occurred.

Recommended Action

If the problem persists, contact the Cisco TAC.

713115

Error Message

%ASA-5-713115: Client rejected NAT enabled IPsec request, falling back to
standard IPsec

Explanation

The client rejected an attempt by the Secure Firewall ASA to use IPsec over UDP.
IPsec over UDP is used to allow multiple clients to establish simultaneous
tunnels to the Secure Firewall ASA through a NAT device. The client may have
rejected the request, either because it does not support this feature or because
it is configured not to use it.

Recommended Action

Verify the configuration on the headend and peer.

713117

Error Message

%ASA-7-713117: Received Invalid SPI notify (SPI SPI_Value )!

Explanation

The IPsec SA identified by the SPI value is no longer active on the remote peer,
which might indicate that the remote peer has rebooted or been reset.

Recommended Action

This problem should correct itself once DPDs recognize that the peer no longer
has the appropriate SAs established. If DPD is not enabled, this may require you
to manually reestablish the affected tunnel.

713118

Error Message

%ASA-3-713118: Detected invalid Diffie-Helmann group_descriptor group_number ,
in IKE area

Explanation

The group_descriptor field included an unsupported value. Currently we support
only groups 1, 2, 5, and 7. In the case of a centry, the group_descriptor field
may also be set to 0 to indicate that perfect forward secrecy is disabled.

Recommended Action

None required.

713205

Error Message

%ASA-3-713205: Could not add static route for client address: IP_address

Explanation

An attempt to add a route to the client-assigned address or to the networks
protected by a hardware client failed. This might indicate duplicate routes in
the routing table or a corrupted network address. The duplicate routes might be
caused by routes that were not cleaned up correctly or by having multiple
clients sharing networks or addresses.

Recommended Action

Check the IP local pool configuration as well as any other IP address-assigning
mechanism being used (for example, DHCP or RADIUS). Make sure that routes are
being cleared from the routing table. Also check the configuration of networks

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA failed while attempting to add a route for the private
address or networks of the peer. In this case, the peer is either a client or a
L2L peer with an unknown address. Both of these cases use dynamic crypto maps to
allow the tunnel. This might indicate duplicate routes, a full routing table, or
a failure of the Secure Firewall ASA to remove previously used routes. Check the
routing table to make sure there is room for additional routes and that obsolete
routes are not present. If the table is full or includes obsolete routes, remove
the routes and try again. If the problem persists, contact the Cisco TAC.

713213

Error Message

713253

Error Message

%ASA-5-713253: Group = group , Username = user , IP = ip , Integrity Firewall
Server is not available. Entering ALLOW mode. VPN Tunnel created for client.

Explanation

When the group policy is configured to require a client to authenticate with a
Zonelab Integrity Server, the server might need to be connected to the
concentrator, depending on the failure policy configured. If the failure policy
is to accept the client connection, and provide unrestricted network access,
this message is generated when a Zonelab Integrity Server is not connected to
the Secure Firewall ASA at the time the client is connecting.
- group - The tunnel group to which the remote access user is connecting
- user - The remote access user
- ip - The IP address of the remote access user

Recommended Action

713257

Error Message

%ASA-5-713257: Phase var1 failure: Mismatched attribute types for class var2 :
Rcv'd: var3 Cfg'd: var4

Explanation

An Secure Firewall ASA has acted as the responder in a LAN-to-LAN connection. It
indicates that the Secure Firewall ASA crypto configuration does not match the
configuration of the initiator. The message specifies during which phase the
mismatch occurred, and which attributes both the responder and the initiator had
that were different.
- var1 - The phase during which the mismatch occurred
- var2 - The class to which the attributes that do not match belong
- var3 - The attribute received from the initiator
- var4 - The attribute configured

Recommended Action

Check the crypto configuration on both of the LAN-to-LAN devices for
inconsistencies. In particular, if a mismatch between UDP-Tunnel (NAT-T) and
something else is reported, check the crypto maps. If one configuration has
NAT-T disabled on the matched crypto map and the other does not, this will cause
a failure.

713258

Error Message

%ASA-3-713258: IP = var1 , Attempting to establish a phase2 tunnel on var2

crypto maps to allow the tunnel. The route may have already been deleted, or an
internal software error has occurred.
- IP_address - The base IP address of the destination network of the peer
- prefix_len - The length of the subnet prefix according to CIDR notation

Recommended Action

If the route has already been deleted, the condition is benign and the device
will function normally. If the problem persists or can be linked to routing
issues over VPN tunnels, then check the routing and addressing portions of the
VPN L2L configuration. Also check the reverse route injection and the ACLs
associated with the appropriate crypto map. If the problem persists, contact the
Cisco TAC.

715051

Error Message

%ASA-7-715051: Received unexpected TLV type TLV_type while processing FWTYPE
ModeCfg Reply

Explanation

An unknown TLV was received in an Secure Firewall ASA record while an FWTYPE
ModeCfg Reply was being processed. The TLV will be discarded. This might occur
either because of packet corruption or because the connecting client supports a
later version of the Secure Firewall ASA protocol.

Check the personal FW installed on the Cisco VPN client and the personal
firewall configuration on the Secure Firewall ASA. This may also indicate a
version mismatch between the VPN client and the Secure Firewall ASA.

715052

Error Message

%ASA-7-715052: Old P1 SA is being deleted but new SA is DEAD, cannot transition
centries

Explanation

The old P1 SA is being deleted, but has no new SA to transition to because it
was marked for deletion as well. This generally indicates that the two IKE peers
are out-of-sync with each other and may be using different rekey times. The
problem should correct itself, but there may be some small amount of data loss
until a fresh P1 SA is reestablished.

Recommended Action

None required.

715056

Error Message

%ASA-7-715056: Client is configured for TCP_transparency

Explanation

Because the remote end (client) is configured for IPsec over TCP, the headend
Secure Firewall ASA must not negotiate IPsec over UDP or IPsec over NAT-T with
the client.

Recommended Action

The NAT transparency configuration may require adjustment of one of the peers if
the tunnel does not come up.

715057

Error Message

%ASA-7-715057: Auto-detected a NAT device with NAT-Traversal. Ignoring
IPsec-over-UDP configuration.

NAT-Traversal was detected.

Recommended Action

None required.

715058

Error Message

%ASA-7-715058: NAT-Discovery payloads missing. Aborting NAT-Traversal.

Explanation

The remote end did not provide NAT-Discovery payloads required for NAT-Traversal
after exchanging NAT-Traversal VIDs. At least two NAT-Discovery payloads must be
received.

Recommended Action

This may indicate a nonconforming NAT-T implementation. If the offending peer is
a Cisco product and the problem persists, contact the Cisco TAC. If the
offending peer is not a Cisco product, then contact the manufacturer support
team.

715059

Error Message

sa

Explanation

The LAN-TO-LAN SA that is being established already exists, that is, an SA with
the same remote network, but is sourced from a different peer. This new SA will
be deleted, because this is not a legal configuration.

Recommended Action

Check the LAN-TO-LAN configuration on all associated peers. Specifically,
multiple peers should not be sharing private networks.

715068

Error Message

%ASA-7-715068: QM IsRekeyed: duplicate sa found by address , deleting old sa

Explanation

The remote access SA that is being established already exists, that is, an SA
with the same remote network, but is sourced from a different peer. The old SA
will be deleted, because the peer may have changed its IP address.

correctly. If the problem persists, contact the Cisco TAC.

715075

Error Message

%ASA-7-715075: Group = group_name , IP = IP_address Received keep-alive of type
message_type (seq number number )

Explanation

This message is paired with DPD R-U-THERE message 715036, which logs the DPD
sending messages.
- group_name - The VPN group name of the peer
- IP_address - IP address of the VPN peer
- message_type - The message type (DPD R-U-THERE or DPD R-U-THERE-ACK)
- number - The DPD sequence number
Two possible cases:
- Received peer sending DPD R-U-THERE message
- Received peer reply DPD R-U-THERE-ACK message
Be aware of the following:
- The DPD R-U-THERE message is received and its sequence number matches the
outgoing DPD reply messages.
If the Secure Firewall ASA sends a DPD R-U-THERE-ACK message without first
receiving a DPD R-U-THERE message from the peer, it is likely experiencing a
security breech.
- The received DPD R-U-THERE-ACK message's sequence number is matched with
previously sent DPD messages.
If the Secure Firewall ASA did not receive a DPD R-U-THERE-ACK message within a
reasonable amount of time after sending a DPD R-U-THERE message to the peer, the
tunnel is most likely down.

Recommended Action

None required.

717013

Error Message

%ASA-5-717013: Removing a cached CRL to accommodate an incoming CRL. Issuer:
issuer

Explanation

When the device is configured to authenticate IPsec tunnels using digital
certificates, CRLs may be cached in memory to avoid requiring a CRL download
during each connection. If the cache fills to the point where an incoming CRL
cannot be accommodated, older CRLs will be removed until the required space is
made available. This message is generated for each purged CRL.
- issuer - The name of the device that removes cached CRLs

Recommended Action

None required.

717014

Error Message

%ASA-5-717014: Unable to cache a CRL received from CDP due to size limitations
(CRL size = size , available cache space = space )

Explanation

When the device is configured to authenticate IPsec tunnels using digital
certificates, CRLs may be cached in memory to avoid requiring a CRL download
during each connection. This message is generated if a received CRL is too large
to fit in the cache. Large CRLs are still supported even though they are not
cached. This means that the CRL will be downloaded with each IPsec connection,
which may affect performance during IPsec connection bursts.

Recommended Action

None required.

717015

Error Message

%ASA-3-717015: CRL received from issuer is too large to process (CRL size =
crl_size , maximum CRL size = max_crl_size )

Explanation

An IPsec connection caused a CRL that is larger than the maximum permitted CRL
size to be downloaded. This error condition causes the connection to fail. This
message is rate limited to one message every 10 seconds.

Recommended Action

Scalability is perhaps the most significant drawback to the CRL method of
revocation checking. To solve this problem, the only options are to investigate
a CA-based solution to reduce the CRL size or configure the Secure Firewall ASA
not to require CRL validation.

717016

Error Message

%ASA-6-717016: Removing expired CRL from the CRL cache. Issuer: issuer

Explanation

When the Secure Firewall ASA is configured to authenticate IPsec tunnels using
digital certificates, CRLs may be cached in memory to avoid requiring a CRL
download during each connection. This message is generated when either the CA
specified expiration time or the configured cache time has lapsed and the CRL is
removed from the cache.

Recommended Action

None required.

717017

Error Message

%ASA-3-717017: Failed to query CA certificate for trustpoint trustpoint_name
from enrollment_url

Explanation

An error occurred when an attempt was made to authenticate a trustpoint by
requesting a CA certificate from a certificate authority.

Recommended Action

Make sure that an enrollment URL is configured with this trustpoint, ensure
connectivity with the CA server, then retry the request.

717018

Error Message

%ASA-3-717018: CRL received from issuer has too many entries to process (number
of entries = number_of_entries , maximum number allowed = max_allowed )

Explanation

An IPsec connection caused a CRL that includes more revocation entries than can
be supported to be downloaded. This is an error condition that will cause the
connection to fail. This message is rate limited to one message every 10
seconds.
- issuer - The X.500 name of the CRLs issuer
- number_of_entries - The number of revocation entries in the received CRL
- max_allowed - The maximum number of CRL entries that the Secure Firewall ASA
supports

Recommended Action

Scalability is perhaps the most significant drawback to the CRL method of
revocation checking. The only options to solve this problem are to investigate a
CA-based solution to reduce the CRL size or configure the Secure Firewall ASA
not to require CRL validation.

717019

Error Message
