733100

Error Message

%ASA-4-733100: Object drop rate rate_ID exceeded. Current burst rate is rate_val
per second, max configured rate is rate_val ; Current average rate is rate_val
per second, max configured rate is rate_val ; Cumulative total count is
total_cnt

Explanation

The specified object in the message has exceeded the specified burst threshold
rate or average threshold rate. The object can be a drop activity of a host,
TCP/UDP port, IP protocol, or various drops caused by potential attacks. The
Secure Firewall ASA may be under attack.
- Object - The general or particular source of a drop rate count, which might
include the following:
  - Firewall
  - Bad pkts
  - Rate limit
  - DoS attck
  - ACL drop
  - Conn limit
  - ICMP attk
  - Scanning
  - SYN attck
  - Inspect
  - Interface
(A citation of a particular interface object might take a number of forms. For
example, you might see 80/HTTP, which would signify port 80, with the well-known
protocol HTTP.)
- rate_ID - The configured rate that is being exceeded. Most objects can be
configured with up to three different rates for different intervals.
- rate_val - A particular rate value.
- total_cnt - The total count since the object was created or cleared.
The following three examples show how these variables occur:
- For an interface drop caused by a CPU or bus limitation:
%ASA-4-733100: [Interface] drop rate 1 exceeded. Current burst rate is 1 per
second, max configured rate is 8000; Current average rate is 2030 per second,
max configured rate is 2000; Cumulative total count is 3930654.‚Äù
- For a scanning drop caused by potential attacks:
%ASA-4-733100: [Scanning] drop rate-1 exceeded. Current burst rate is 10 per
second_max configured rate is 10; Current average rate is 245 per second_max
configured rate is 5; Cumulative total count is 147409 (35 instances received)
- For bad packets caused by potential attacks:
%ASA-4-733100: [Bad pkts] drop rate 1 exceeded. Current burst rate is 0 per
second, max configured rate is 400; Current average rate is 760 per second, max
configured rate is 100; Cumulative total count is 1938933
- Because of the scanning rate configured and the threat-detection rate
scanning-rate 3600 average-rate 15 command:
%ASA-4-733100: [144.60.88.2] drop rate-2 exceeded. Current burst rate is 0 per
second, max configured rate is 8; Current average rate is 5 per second, max
configured rate is 4; Cumulative total count is 38086
Perform the following steps according to the specified object type that appears
in the message:
1. If the object in the message is one of the following:
- Firewall
- Bad pkts
- Rate limit
- DoS attck
- ACL drop
- Conn limit
- ICMP attck
- Scanning
- SYN attck
- Inspect
- Interface

Recommended Action

Check whether the drop rate is acceptable for the running environment.
1. Adjust the threshold rate of the particular drop to an appropriate value by
using the threat-detection rate xxx command, where xxx is one of the following:
- acl-drop
- bad-packet-drop
- conn-limit-drop
- dos-drop
- fw-drop
- icmp-drop
- inspect-drop
- interface-drop
- scanning-threat
- syn-attack
2. If the object in the message is a TCP or UDP port, an IP address, or a host
drop, check whether or not the drop rate is acceptable for the running
environment.
3. Adjust the threshold rate of the particular drop to an appropriate value by
using the threat-detection rate bad-packet-drop command.
Note: If you do not want the drop rate exceed warning to appear, you can disable
it by using the no threat-detection basic-threat command.

733101

Error Message

%ASA-4-733101: Object objectIP (is targeted|is attacking). Current burst rate is
rate_val per second, max configured rate is rate_val ; Current average rate is
rate_val per second, max configured rate is rate_val ; Cumulative total count is
total_cnt.

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA detected that a specific host (or several hosts in the
same 1024-node subnet) is either scanning the network (attacking), or is being
scanned (targeted).
- object - Attacker or target (a specific host or several hosts in the same
1024-node subnet)
- objectIP - The IP address of the scanning attacker or scanned target
- rate_val - A particular rate value
- total_cnt - The total count
The following two examples show how these variables occur:
%ASA-4-733101: Subnet 100.0.0.0 is targeted. Current burst rate is 200 per
second, max configured rate is 0; Current average rate is 0 per second, max
configured rate is 0; Cumulative total count is 2028.
%ASA-4-733101: Host 175.0.0.1 is attacking. Current burst rate is 200 per
second, max configured rate is 0; Current average rate is 0 per second, max
configured rate is 0; Cumulative total count is 2024

Recommended Action

For the specific host or subnet, use the show threat-detection statistics host
ip-address ip-mask command to check the overall situation and then adjust the
threshold rate of the scanning threat to the appropriate value. After the
appropriate value is determined, an optional action can be taken to shun those
host attackers (not subnet attacker) by configuring the threat-detection
scanning-threat shun-host command. You may specify certain hosts or object
groups in the shun-host except list. For more information, see the CLI
configuration guide. If scanning detection is not desirable, you can disable
this feature by using the no threat-detection scanning command.

733102

Error Message

%ASA-4-733102:Threat-detection adds host %I to shun list

Explanation

A host has been shunned by the threat detection engine. When the
threat-detection scanning-threat shun command is configured, the attacking hosts
will be shunned by the threat detection engine.
- %I - A particular hostname
The following message shows how this command was implemented:
%ASA-4-733102: Threat-detection add host 11.1.1.40 to shun list

Recommended Action

To investigate whether the shunned host is an actual attacker, use the
threat-detection statistics host ip-address command. If the shunned host is not
an attacker, you can remove the shunned host from the threat detection engine by
using the clear threat-detection shun ip address command. To remove all shunned
hosts from the threat detection engine, use the clear shun command. If you
receive this message because an inappropriate threshold rate has been set to
trigger the threat detection engine, then adjust the threshold rate by using the
threat-detection rate scanning-threat rate-interval x average-rate y burst-rate
z command.

733103

Error Message

%ASA-4-733103: Threat-detection removes host %I from shun list

Explanation

A host has been shunned by the threat detection engine. When you use the
clear-threat-detection shun command, the specified host will be removed from the
shunned list.
- %I - A particular hostname
The following message shows how this command is implemented:
%ASA-4-733103: Threat-detection removes host 11.1.1.40 from shun list

Recommended Action

None required.
