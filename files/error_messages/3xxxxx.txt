No valid          This counter is incremented when the Secure Firewall ASA tried
adjacency         to obtain an adjacency and could not obtain the MAC address
                  for the next hop. The packet is dropped.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pinhole Timeout   The counter is incremented to report that the Secure Firewall
                  ASA opened a secondary flow, but no packets passed through
                  this flow within the timeout interval, and so it was removed.
                  An example of a secondary flow is the FTP data channel that is

Route change      When the Secure Firewall ASA adds a lower cost (better metric)
                  route, packets arriving that match the new route cause their
                  existing connection to be torn down after the user-configured
                  timeout (floating-conn) value. Subsequent packets rebuild the
                  connection out of the interface with the better metric. To
                  prevent the addition of lower cost routes from affecting
                  active flows, you can set the floating-conn configuration
                  timeout value to 0:0:0.

Explanation

The specified host tried to access the specified URL If you enable the HTTP
inspection with custom HTTP policy map, the following possibilities are
seen.When the packet of GET request does not have the hostname parameter,
instead of printing the URI, it prints the following message:%ASA-5-304001:
client IP Accessed URL server ip:Hostname not present URI: URIIf a large URI
which cannot be printed in a single syslog, you can print partial wherever it is
being chopped down.For instance, when the URL is to be divided into multiple
chunks and logged, the following message is printed:%ASA-5-304001: client IP

304007

Error Message

%ASA-2-304007: URL Server IP_address not responding, ENTERING ALLOW mode.

Explanation

You used the allow option of the filter command, and the Websense servers are
not responding. The ASA allows all web requests to continue without filtering
while the servers are not available.

Recommended Action

None required.

304008

Error Message

%ASA-2-304008: LEAVING ALLOW mode, URL Server is up.

Explanation

You used the allow option of the filter command, and the ASA receives a response
message from a Websense server that previously was not responding. With this
response message, the ASA exits the allow mode, which enables the URL filtering
feature again.

Recommended Action

None required.

Error Message

%ASA-3-305005: No translation group found for protocol src interface_name:
source_address/source_port [(idfw_user )] dst interface_name: dest_address
/dest_port [(idfw_user )]

Explanation

A packet does not match any of the outbound nat command rules. If NAT is not
configured for the specified source and destination systems, the message will be
generated frequently.

Recommended Action

This message indicates a configuration error. If dynamic NAT is desired for the
source host, ensure that the nat command matches the source IP address. If
static NAT is desired for the source host, ensure that the local IP address of
the static command matches. If no NAT is desired for the source host, check the
ACL bound to the NAT 0 ACL.

305006

Error Message

%ASA-3-305006: {outbound static|identity|portmap|regular) translation creation
failed for protocol src interface_name:source_address/source_port [(idfw_user )]
dst interface_name:dest_address/dest_port [(idfw_user )]

Explanation

The ICMP error inspection was enabled and the following conditions were met:
- There was a connection established through the device with forward and reverse
flows having different protocols. For example, forward flow is UDP or TCP,
reverse flow is ICMP. The switch in protocols occurs when either the receiver or
any intermediary device in the path returns ICMP error messages, for example
type 3 code 3.
- There was a dynamic NAT/PAT statement that matched the packets of the reverse
flow and failed to translate the outer header IP addresses because the device
does not apply PAT to all ICMP message types; it only applies PAT ICMP echo and
echo-reply packets (types 8 and 0).

Recommended Action

None required.

305007

Error Message

%ASA-6-305007: addrpool_free(): Orphan IP IP_address on interface
interface_number

Explanation

The ASA has attempted to translate an address that it cannot find in any of its
global pools. The ASA assumes that the address was deleted and drops the
request.

Recommended Action

None required.

305008

Error Message

%ASA-3-305008: Free unallocated global IP address.

Explanation

The ASA kernel detected an inconsistency condition when trying to free an
unallocated global IP address back to the address pool. This abnormal condition
may occur if the ASA is running a Stateful Failover setup, and some of the
internal states are momentarily out of sync between the active unit and the
standby unit. This condition is not catastrophic, and the synchronization
recovers automatically.

Recommended Action

If the problem persists, contact the Cisco TAC.

305009

Error Message

%ASA-6-305009: Built {dynamic|static} translation from interface_name

Connection protocol src interface_name :source_address /source_port [(idfw_user
)] dst interface_name :dst_address /dst_port [(idfw_user )] denied due to NAT
reverse path failure.

Explanation

An attempt to connect to a mapped host using its actual address was rejected.

Recommended Action

When not on the same interface as the host using NAT, use the mapped address
instead of the actual address to connect to the host. In addition, enable the
inspect command if the application embeds the IP address.

305014

Error Message

%ASA-6-305014: Allocated block of ports for translation from real_interface

Error Message

%ASA-3-305016: Unable to create protocol connection from real_interface
:real_host_ip /real_source_port to real_dest_interface :real_dest_ip
/real_dest_port due to reason .

Explanation

The maximum port blocks per host limit has been reached for a host or the port
blocks have been exhausted.
- reason - May be one of the following:
  - reaching per-host PAT port block limit of value
  - port block exhaustion in PAT pool

Recommended Action

For reaching the per-host PAT port block limit, review the maximum blocks per
host limit by entering the following command:
xlate block-allocation maximum-per-host 4
For the port block exhaustion in the PAT pool, we recommend increasing the pool
size. Also, review the block size by entering the following command:
xlate block-allocation size 512

305017

Recommended Action

None.

305019

Error Message

%ASA-3-305019: MAP node address ip/port has inconsistent Port Set ID encoding

Explanation

A packet has an address that matches MAP basic mapping rules (meaning it is
meant to be translated) but the Port Set ID encoded within the address is
inconsistent (per RFC7599). This could be due to a software fault on the MAP
node where this packet originates.
Example
%ASA-3-305019: MAP node address 2001:DB8:0000:FFFF:0000:0000:0000:0002/57964
has inconsistent
Port Set ID encoding

Recommended Action

None.

305020

Error Message

%ASA-3-305020: MAP node with address ip is not allowed to use port port

Explanation

A packet has an address that matches MAP basic mapping rules (meaning it is
meant to be translated) but the associated port does not fall within the range
allocated to that address. This likely means there is misconfiguration on the
MAP node where this packet originates.
Example:
%ASA-3-305020: MAP node with address 2001:DB8:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0002
is not allowed to use port 37964

Recommended Action

None.

305021

Error Message

%ASA-4-305021: Ports exhausted in pre-allocated PAT pool IP mapped_ip_address
for host real_host_ip. Allocating from new PAT pool IP mapped_ip_address.

Explanation

This message is generated when all ports are exhausted in the sticky IP on a
cluster node and allocation moves to the next available IP with free ports.
Example:
%ASA-4-305021: Ports exhausted in pre-allocated PAT pool IP 174.0.1.1 for
host 192.168.1.20. Allocating from new PAT pool IP 174.0.1.2.

Recommended Action

None.

305022

Error Message

%ASA-4-305022: Cluster unit unit_name has been allocated num_of_port_blocks port
blocks for PAT usage. All units should have at least min_num_of_port_blocks port
blocks.

Explanation

This message is generated on a node when it joins cluster and does not get any
or unequal share of port blocks.
Examples:
%ASA-4-305022: Cluster unit ASA-4 has been allocated 0 port blocks for PAT
usage. All units should have at least 32 port blocks.
%ASA-4-305022: Cluster unit ASA-4 has been allocated 12 port blocks for PAT
usage. All units should have at least 32 port blocks.

Recommended Action

None.

308001

Error Message

%ASA-6-308001: console enable password incorrect for number tries (from
IP_address )

Explanation

This is a Secure Firewall ASA management message. This message appears after the
specified number of times a user incorrectly types the password to enter
privileged mode. The maximum is three attempts.

Recommended Action

Verify the password and try again.

308002

Error Message

%ASA-4-308002: static global_address inside_address netmask netmask overlapped
with global_address inside_address

Explanation

The IP addresses in one or more static command statements overlap.
global_address is the global address, which is the address on the lower security
interface, and inside_address is the local address, which is the address on the
higher security-level interface.

Recommended Action

Use the show static command to view the static command statements in your
configuration and fix the commands that overlap. The most common overlap occurs
if you specify a network address such as 10.1.1.0, and in another static command
you specify a host within that range, such as 10.1.1.5.

308003

Error Message

%ASA-4-308003: WARNING: The enable password is not configured

Explanation

When entering enable mode (privilege level 2 or greater), you are forced to
configure the enable password for privilege level 15 when the enable password is
not already set.

Recommended Action

Set the enable password. The permitted length of password is between 3 and 15.

308004

Error Message

%ASA-4-308004: The enable password has been configured by user admin

Explanation

You have configured the enable password for the first time. This message will

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA received a RIP message with an operation code other than
reply, the message has a version number different from what is expected on this
interface, and the routing domain entry was nonzero. Another RIP device may not
be configured correctly to communicate with the Secure Firewall ASA.

Recommended Action

None required.

313001

Error Message

%ASA-3-313001: Denied ICMP type=number , code=code from IP_address on interface
interface_name

Explanation

When using the icmp command with an access list, if the first matched entry is a
permit entry, the ICMP packet continues processing. If the first matched entry
is a deny entry, or an entry is not matched, the Secure Firewall ASA discards
the ICMP packet and generates this message. The icmp command enables or disables
pinging to an interface. With pinging disabled, the Secure Firewall ASA cannot
be detected on the network. This feature is also referred to as configurable
proxy pinging.

Recommended Action

Contact the administrator of the peer device.

313004

Error Message

%ASA-4-313004:Denied ICMP type=icmp_type , from source_address on interface
interface_name to dest_address :no matching session

Explanation

ICMP packets were dropped by the Secure Firewall ASA because of security checks
added by the stateful ICMP feature that are usually either ICMP echo replies
without a valid echo request already passed across the Secure Firewall ASA or
ICMP error messages not related to any TCP, UDP, or ICMP session already
established in the Secure Firewall ASA.

Recommended Action

None required.

313005

Error Message

%ASA-4-313005: No matching connection for ICMP error message: icmp_msg_info on

source_address /source_port [([idfw_user | FQDN_string ], sg_info )] dst
dest_address /dest_port [(idfw_user |FQDN_string ), sg_info ]

Explanation

ICMP error packets were dropped by the Secure Firewall ASA because the ICMP
error messages are not related to any session already established in the Secure
Firewall ASA.

Recommended Action

If the cause is an attack, you can deny the host by using ACLs.

313008

Error Message

%ASA-3-313008: Denied ICMPv6 type=number , code=code from IP_address on
interface interface_name

Explanation

When using the icmp command with an access list, if the first matched entry is a
permit entry, the ICMPv6 packet continues processing. If the first matched entry
is a deny entry, or an entry is not matched, the Secure Firewall ASA discards
the ICMPv6 packet and generates this message. The icmp command enables or
disables pinging to an interface. When pinging is disabled, the Secure Firewall
ASA is undetectable on the network. This feature is also referred to as
“configurable proxy pinging.”

Recommended Action

Contact the administrator of the peer device.

313009

Error Message

%ASA-4-313009: Denied invalid ICMP code icmp-code , for src-ifc :src-address
/src-port (mapped-src-address/mapped-src-port) to dest-ifc :dest-address

ICMP type icmp-type

Explanation

An ICMP echo request/reply packet was received with a malformed code(non-zero).

Recommended Action

If it is an intermittent event, no action is required. If the cause is an
attack, you can deny the host using the ACLs.

314001

Error Message

%ASA-6-314001: Pre-allocated RTSP UDP backconnection for src_intf :src_IP to
dst_intf :dst_IP /dst_port.

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA opened a UDP media channel for the RTSP client that was
receiving data from the server.
- src_intf - Source interface name
- src_IP - Source interface IP address
- dst_intf - Destination interface name
- dst_IP - Destination IP address
- dst_port - Destination port

Recommended Action

None required.

314002

Error Message

%ASA-6-314002: RTSP failed to allocate UDP media connection from src_intf
:src_IP to dst_intf :dst_IP /dst_port : reason_string.

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA cannot open a new pinhole for the media channel.
- src_intf - Source interface name
- src_IP - Source interface IP address
- dst_intf - Destination interface name
- dst_IP - Destination IP address
- dst_port - Destination port
- reason_string - Pinhole already exists/Unknown

Recommended Action

If the reason is unknown, check the free memory available by running the show
memory command, or the number of connections used by running the show conn
command, because the Secure Firewall ASA is low on memory.

314003

Error Message

%ASA-6-314003: Dropped RTSP traffic from src_intf :src_ip due to: reason.

Explanation

The RTSP message violated the user-configured RTSP security policy, either
because it contains a port from the reserve port range, or it contains a URL
with a length greater than the maximum limit allowed.
- src_intf - Source interface name
- src_IP - Source interface IP address
- reason - The reasons may be one of the following:
  - Endpoint negotiating media ports in the reserved port range from 0 to 1024
  - URL length of url length bytes exceeds the maximum url length limit bytes

Recommended Action

Investigate why the RTSP client sends messages that violate the security policy.
If the requested URL is legitimate, you can relax the policy by specifying a
longer URL length limit in the RTSP policy map.

314004

Error Message

%ASA-6-314004: RTSP client src_intf:src_IP accessed RTSP URL RTSP URL

Explanation

An RTSP client tried to access an RTSP server.

Explanation

A specific RTSP request message exceeded the configured rate limit of RTSP
policy.
- src_intf - Source interface name
- src_IP - Source interface IP address
- rate - Configured rate limit
- request_method - Type of request message

Recommended Action

Investigate why the specific RTSP request message from the client exceeded the
rate limit.

315004

Error Message

%ASA-3-315004: Fail to establish SSH session because RSA host key retrieval
failed.

Explanation

The ASA cannot find the RSA host key, which is required for establishing an SSH
session. The ASA host key may be absent because it was not generated or because
the license for this ASA does not allow DES or 3DES encryption.

Recommended Action

From the ASA console, enter the show crypto key mypubkey rsa command to verify
that the RSA host key is present. If the host key is not present, enter the show
version command to verify that DES or 3DES is allowed. If an RSA host key is
present, restart the SSH session. To generate the RSA host key, enter the crypto
key mypubkey rsa command.

{statically|dynamically} bound to MAC Address MAC_address_2 .

Explanation

If the ARP inspection module is enabled, it checks whether a new ARP entry
advertised in the packet conforms to the statically configured or dynamically
learned IP-MAC address binding before forwarding ARP packets across the Secure
Firewall ASA. If this check fails, the ARP inspection module drops the ARP
packet and generates this message. This situation may be caused by either ARP
spoofing attacks in the network or an invalid configuration (IP-MAC binding).

Recommended Action

If the cause is an attack, you can deny the host using the ACLs. If the cause is
an invalid configuration, correct the binding.

Address.

Explanation

If the ARP inspection module is enabled, it checks whether a new ARP entry
advertised in the packet conforms to the statically configured IP-MAC address
binding before forwarding ARP packets across the Secure Firewall ASA. If this
check fails, the ARP inspection module drops the ARP packet and generates this
message. This situation may be caused by either ARP spoofing attacks in the
network or an invalid configuration (IP-MAC binding).

Recommended Action

If the cause is an attack, you can deny the host using the ACLs. If the cause is
an invalid configuration, correct the binding.

323005

Error Message

%ASA-3-323005: Module module_id can not be started completely
%ASA-3-323005: Module in slot slot_num cannot be started completely

Explanation

This message indicates that the module cannot be started completely. The module
will remain in the UNRESPONSIVE state until this condition is corrected. A
module that is not fully seated in the slot is the most likely cause.
- module_id - For a software services module, specifies the service module name.
- slot_num - For a hardware services module, specifies the slot number that
contains the module.

Recommended Action

Verify that the module is fully seated and check to see if any status LEDs on
the module are on. It may take a minute after fully reseating the module for the
Secure Firewall ASA to recognize that it is powered up. If this message appears
after verifying that the module is seated and after resetting the module using
either the sw-module module service-module-name reset command or the hw-module
module slotnum reset command, contact the Cisco TAC.

323006

Error Message

%ASA-1-323006: Module ips experienced a data channel communication failure, data
channel is DOWN.

Explanation

A data channel communication failure occurred and the Secure Firewall ASA was
unable to forward traffic to the services module. This failure triggers a
failover when the failure occurs on the active Secure Firewall ASA in an HA
configuration. The failure also results in the configured fail open or fail
closed policy being enforced on traffic that would normally be sent to the
services module. This message is generated whenever a communication problem over
the Secure Firewall ASA dataplane occurs between the system module and the
services module, which can be caused when the services module stops, resets, is
removed or disabled.

Recommended Action

For software services modules such as IPS, recover the module using the
sw-module module ips recover command. For hardware services modules, if this
message is not the result of the SSM reloading or resetting and the
corresponding syslog message 505010 is not seen after the SSM returns to an UP
state, reset the module using the hw-module module 1 reset command.

323007

Error Message

%ASA-3-323007: Module in slot slot experienced a firware failure and the
recovery is in progress.

Explanation

An Secure Firewall ASA with a 4GE-SSM installed experienced a short power surge,
then rebooted. As a result, the 4GE-SSM may come online in an unresponsive
state. The Secure Firewall ASA has detected that the 4GE-SSM is unresponsive,
and automatically restarts the 4GE-SSM.

Recommended Action

None required.

There was an error processing the packet. The following are possible reasons:
- Mandatory IE is missing
- Mandatory IE incorrect
- IE out of sequence
- Invalid message format.
- Optional IE incorrect
- Invalid TEID
- Unknown IE
- Bad length field
- Unknown GTP message.
- Message too short
- Unexpected message seen
- Null TID
- Version not supported

Recommended Action

If this message is seen periodically, it can be ignored. If it is seen
frequently, then the endpoint may be sending out bad packets as part of an
attack.

324002

Error Message

%ASA-3-324002: No PDP[MCB] exists to process GTPv0 msg_type from
source_interface :source_address /source_port to dest_interface :dest_address
/dest_port , TID: tid_value

Explanation

If this message was preceded by message 321100, memory allocation error, the
message indicates that there were not enough resources to create the PDP
context. If not, it was not preceded by message 321100. For version 0, it
indicates that the corresponding PDP context cannot be found. For version 1, if
this message was preceded by message 324001, then a packet processing error
occurred, and the operation stopped.

Recommended Action

If the problem persists, determine why the source is sending packets without a
valid PDP context.

324003

Error Message

%ASA-3-324003: No matching request to process GTPv version msg_type from
source_interface:source_address/source_port to
source_interface:dest_address/dest_port

Explanation

The response received does not have a matching request in the request queue and

[CellID cellID]

Explanation

A message appears when the location has changed. MCC is always 3 digits and MNC
is 2 or 3 digits. This change could be triggered by handoff or a subsequent
create request after the PDP is created and that the previous create request on
ASA expired.
Note: The MCC, MNC, IE type, or Cell ID could be "Unknown" if the packet does
not contain the location information IEs.
Example:
%ASA-5-324011: Subscriber ID location changed during v1 handoff from MCC/MNC
11122 (v1 RAI/v1 ULI-CGI) CellID 1 to MCC/MNC 111222 (v1 RAI/v1 ULI-CGI) CellID

Explanation

When a shared secret is configured for a host, the request authenticator is
verified with that secret. If it fails, it is logged and packet processing
stops.
- from_addr - The IP address of the host sending the RADIUS accounting request

Recommended Action

Check to see that the correct shared secret was configured. If it is,
double-check the source of the packet to make sure that it was not spoofed.

324301

Error Message

%ASA-3-324301: Radius Accounting Request has a bad header length hdr_len ,

If this message occurs at the end of the call, it is considered normal because
the signaling messages may have released the media session, but the endpoint is
continuing to send a few SRTP or RTP packets. If this message occurs for an
odd-numbered media termination port, the endpoint is sending RTCP, which must be
disabled from the CUCM. If this message happens continuously for a call, debug
the signaling message transaction either using phone proxy debug commands or
capture commands to determine if the signaling messages are being modified with
the media termination IP address and port..
