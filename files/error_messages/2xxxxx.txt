201002

Error Message

%ASA-3-201002: Too many TCP connections on {static|xlate} global_address !
econns nconns

Explanation

The maximum number of TCP connections to the specified global address was
exceeded.
- econns - The maximum number of embryonic connections
- nconns - The maximum number of connections permitted for the static or xlate
global address

Recommended Action

Use the show static or show nat command to check the limit imposed on
connections to a static address. The limit is configurable.

201003

Error Message

%ASA-2-201003: Embryonic limit exceeded nconns/elimit for
outside_address/outside_port (global_address ) inside_address /inside_port on
interface interface_name

Explanation

The number of embryonic connections from the specified foreign address with the
specified static global address to the specified local address exceeds the
embryonic limit. When the limit on embryonic connections to the Secure Firewall
ASA is reached, the Secure Firewall ASA attempts to accept them anyway, but puts
a time limit on the connections. This situation allows some connections to
succeed even if the Secure Firewall ASA is very busy. This message indicates a
more serious overload than message 201002, which can be caused by a SYN attack,
or by a very heavy load of legitimate traffic.
- nconns - The maximum number of embryonic connections received
- elimit - The maximum number of embryonic connections specified in the static
or nat command  

Recommended Action

Use the show static command to check the limit imposed on embryonic connections
to a static address.

201004

Error Message

%ASA-3-201004: Too many UDP connections on {static|xlate} global_address!udp
connections limit

Explanation

The maximum number of UDP connections to the specified global address was
exceeded.
- udp conn limit - The maximum number of UDP connections permitted for the
static address or translation 

Recommended Action

Use the show static or show nat command to check the limit imposed on
connections to a static address. You can configure the limit.

201005

Error Message

%ASA-3-201005: FTP data connection failed for IP_address IP_address

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA cannot allocate a structure to track the data connection
for FTP because of insufficient memory.

Recommended Action

Reduce the amount of memory usage or purchase additional memory.

201006

Error Message

%ASA-3-201006: RCMD backconnection failed for IP_address/port.

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA cannot preallocate connections for inbound standard
output for rsh commands because of insufficient memory.

Recommended Action

Check the rsh client version; the Secure Firewall ASA only supports the Berkeley
rsh client version. You can also reduce the amount of memory usage, or purchase
additional memory.

201008

Error Message

%ASA-3-201008: Disallowing new connections.

Explanation

You have enabled TCP system log messaging and the syslog server cannot be
reached, or when using the ASA syslog server (PFSS) and the disk on the Windows
NT system is full, or when the auto-update timeout is configured and the
auto-update server is not reachable.

Recommended Action

Disable TCP syslog messaging. If using PFSS, free up space on the Windows NT
system where PFSS resides. Also, make sure that the syslog server is up and you
can ping the host from the ASA console. Then restart TCP system message logging
to allow traffic. If the Auto Update Server has not been contacted for a certain
period of time, enter the [no] auto-update timeout period command to have it
stop sending packets.

201009

Error Message

%ASA-3-201009: TCP connection limit of number for host IP_address on
interface_name exceeded  

Explanation

The maximum number of connections to the specified static address was exceeded.
- number - The maximum of connections permitted for the host
- IP_address - The host IP address
- interface_name - The name of the interface to which the host is connected

Recommended Action

Use the show static and show nat commands to check the limit imposed on
connections to an address. The limit is configurable.

201010

Error Message

%ASA-6-201010: Embryonic connection limit exceeded econns/limit for dir packet
from source_address/source_port to dest_address/dest_port on interface
interface_name

Explanation

An attempt to establish a TCP connection failed because of an exceeded embryonic
connection limit, which was configured with the set connection
embryonic-conn-max MPC command for a traffic class. To reduce the impact of
anomalous incoming traffic on ASA's different management interfaces and
protocols, the interfaces are configured with a default embryonic limit of 100.
This syslog message appears when the embryonic connections to ASA interface
exceeds 100. This default value cannot be modified or disabled.
- econns - The current count of embryonic connections associated to the
configured traffic class
- limit - The configured embryonic connection limit for the traffic class
- dir - input: The first packet that initiates the connection is an input packet
on the interface interface_name output: The first packet that initiates the
connection is an output packet on the interface interface_name
- source_address/source_port - The source real IP address and the source port of
the packet initiating the connection
- dest_address/dest_port - The destination real IP address and the destination
port of the packet initiating the connection
- interface_name - The name of the interface on which the policy limit is
enforced

Recommended Action

None required.

201011

Error Message

%ASA-3-201011: Connection limit exceeded cnt /limit for dir packet from sip
/sport to dip /dport on interface if_name .

Explanation

A new connection through the Secure Firewall ASA resulted in exceeding at least
one of the configured maximum connection limits. This message applies both to
connection limits configured using a static command, or to those configured
using Cisco Modular Policy Framework. The new connection will not be allowed
through the Secure Firewall ASA until one of the existing connections is torn
down, which brings the current connection count below the configured maximum.
- cnt - Current connection count
- limit - Configured connection limit
- dir - Direction of traffic, inbound or outbound
- sip - Source real IP address
- sport - Source port
- dip - Destination real IP address
- dpor t - Destination port
- if_name - Name of the interface on which the traffic was received  

Recommended Action

None required.

201012

Error Message

%ASA-6-201012: Per-client embryonic connection limit exceeded curr num /limit
for [input|output] packet from IP_address / port to ip /port on interface
interface_name

Explanation

An attempt to establish a TCP connection failed because the per-client embryonic
connection limit was exceeded. By default, this message is rate limited to 1
message every 10 seconds.
- curr num - The current number
- limit - The configured limit
- [input|output] - Input or output packet on interface interface_name
- IP_address - Real IP address
- port - TCP or UDP port
- interface_name - The name of the interface on which the policy is applied

Recommended Action

When the limit is reached, any new connection request will be proxied by the
Secure Firewall ASA to prevent a SYN flood attack. The Secure Firewall ASA will
only connect to the server if the client is able to finish the three-way
handshake. This usually does not affect the end user or the application.
However, if this creates a problem for any application that has a legitimate
need for a higher number of embryonic connections, you can adjust the setting by
entering the set connection per-client-embryonic-max command.

201013

Error Message

%ASA-3-201013: Per-client connection limit exceeded curr num /limit for
[input|output] packet from ip /port to ip /port on interface interface_name

Explanation

A connection was rejected because the per-client connection limit was exceeded.
- curr num - The current number
- limit - The configured limit
- [input|output] - The input or output packet on interface interface_name
- ip - The real IP address
- port - The TCP or UDP port
- interface_name - The name of the interface on which the policy is applied

Recommended Action

When the limit is reached, any new connection request will be silently dropped.
Normally an application will retry the connection, which will cause a delay or
even a timeout if all retries also fail. If an application has a legitimate need
for a higher number of concurrent connections, you can adjust the setting by
entering the set connection per-client-max command.

202001

Error Message

%ASA-3-202001: Out of address translation slots!

Explanation

The ASA has no more address translation slots available.

Recommended Action

Check the size of the global pool compared to the number of inside network
clients. A PAT address may be necessary. Alternatively, shorten the timeout
interval of translates and connections. This error message can also be caused by
insufficient memory; reduce the amount of memory usage, or purchase additional
memory, if possible.

202005

Error Message

%ASA-3-202005: Non-embryonic in embryonic list outside_address/outside_port
inside_address/inside_port

Explanation

A connection object (xlate) is in the wrong list.

Recommended Action

Contact the Cisco TAC.

202010

Error Message

%ASA-3-202010: [NAT | PAT] pool exhausted for pool-name , port range [1-511 |
512-1023 | 1024-65535]. Unable to create protocol connection from in-interface
:src-ip /src-port to out-interface :dst-ip /dst-port

Explanation

- pool-name - The name of the NAT or PAT pool
- protocol - The protocol used to create the connection
- in-interface - The ingress interface
- src-ip - The source IP address
- src-port - The source port
- out-interface - The egress interface
- dest-ip - The destination IP address
- dst-port - The destination port

The Secure Firewall ASA has no more address translation pools available.

Recommended Action

Use the show nat pool and show nat detail commands to determine why all
addresses and ports in the pool are used up. If this occurs under normal
conditions, then add additional IP addresses to the NAT/PAT pool.

202016

Error Message

%ASA-3-202016: "%d: Unable to pre-allocate SIP %s secondary channel for message
from %s:%A/%d to %s:%A/%d with PAT and missing port information."

Explanation

When SIP application generates an SDP payload with Media port set to 0, you
cannot allocate a PAT xlate for such invalid port request and drop the packet
with this syslog.

Recommended Action

None. This is an application specific issue.

208005

Error Message

%ASA-3-208005: (function:line_num) clear command return code

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA received a nonzero value (an internal error) when
attempting to clear the configuration in flash memory. The message includes the
reporting subroutine filename and line number.  

Recommended Action

For performance reasons, the end host should be configured not to inject IP
fragments. This configuration change is probably because of NFS. Set the read
and write size equal to the interface MTU for NFS.

209003

Error Message

%ASA-4-209003: Fragment database limit of number exceeded: src = source_address
, dest = dest_address , proto = protocol , id = number

Explanation

Too many IP fragments are currently awaiting reassembly. By default, the maximum
number of fragments is 200 (to raise the maximum, see the fragment size command
in the command reference guide). The Secure Firewall ASA limits the number of IP
fragments that can be concurrently reassembled. This restriction prevents memory
depletion at the Secure Firewall ASA under abnormal network conditions. In
general, fragmented traffic should be a small percentage of the total traffic
mix. An exception is in a network environment with NFS over UDP where a large
percentage is fragmented traffic; if this type of traffic is relayed through the
Secure Firewall ASA, consider using NFS over TCP instead. To prevent
fragmentation, see the sysopt connection tcpmss bytes command in the command
reference guide.

Recommended Action

If this message persists, a denial of service (DoS) attack might be in progress.
Contact the remote peer administrator or upstream provider.

209004

Error Message

%ASA-4-209004: Invalid IP fragment, size = bytes exceeds maximum size = bytes :
src = source_address , dest = dest_address , proto = protocol , id = number

Explanation

An IP fragment is malformed. The total size of the reassembled IP packet exceeds
the maximum possible size of 65,535 bytes.

Recommended Action

A possible intrusion event may be in progress. If this message persists, contact
the remote peer administrator or upstream provider.

209005

Error Message

%ASA-4-209005: Discard IP fragment set with more than number elements: src = Too
many elements are in a fragment set.

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA disallows any IP packet that is fragmented into more
than 24 fragments. For more information, see the fragment command in the command
reference guide.

Recommended Action

A possible intrusion event may be in progress. If the message persists, contact
the remote peer administrator or upstream provider. You can change the number of
fragments per packet by using the fragment chain xxx interface_name command.

209006

Error Message

%ASA-4-209006: Fragment queue threshold exceeded, dropped protocol fragment from
IP address/port to IP address/port on outside interface.

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA drops the fragmented packets when the fragment database
threshold, that is 2/3 of the queue size per interface, has exceeded.

Recommended Action

None required.

210001

Error Message

%ASA-3-210001: LU sw_module_name error = number

Explanation

A Stateful Failover error occurred.

Recommended Action

If this error persists after traffic lessens through the Secure Firewall ASA,
report this error to the Cisco TAC.

210002

Error Message

%ASA-3-210002: LU allocate block (bytes ) failed.

Explanation

Stateful Failover cannot allocate a block of memory to transmit stateful
information to the standby Secure Firewall ASA.

Recommended Action

Check the failover interface using the show interface command to make sure its
transmit is normal. Also check the current block memory using the show block
command. If current available count is 0 within any of the blocks of memory,
then reload the Secure Firewall ASA software to recover the lost blocks of
memory.

210003

Error Message

%ASA-3-210003: Unknown LU Object number

Explanation

Stateful Failover received an unsupported Logical Update object and was unable
to process it. This can be caused by corrupted memory, LAN transmissions, and
other events.

Recommended Action

If you see this error infrequently, then no action is required. If this error
occurs frequently, check the Stateful Failover link LAN connection. If the error
was not caused by a faulty failover link LAN connection, determine if an
external user is trying to compromise the protected network. Also check for
misconfigured clients.

210005

Error Message

%ASA-3-210005: LU allocate secondary (optional ) connection failed for protocol
[TCP |UDP ] connection from ingress interface name :Real IP Address /Real Port
to egress interface name :Real IP Address /Real Port

Explanation

Stateful Failover cannot allocate a new connection on the standby unit. This may
be caused by little or no RAM memory available within the Secure Firewall ASA. 
Note: The secondary field in the syslog message is optional and appears only if
the connection is a secondary connection. 

Recommended Action

Check the available memory using the show memory command to make sure that the
Secure Firewall ASA has free memory. If there is no available memory, add more
physical memory to the Secure Firewall ASA.

210006

Error Message

%ASA-3-210006: LU look NAT for IP_address failed

Explanation

Stateful Failover was unable to locate a NAT group for the IP address on the
standby unit. The active and standby Secure Firewall ASAs may be out-of-sync
with each other.

Recommended Action

Use the write standby command on the active unit to synchronize system memory
with the standby unit.

210007

Error Message

%ASA-3-210007: LU allocate xlate failed for type [static | dynamic ]-[NAT | PAT
] secondary(optional) protocol translation from ingress interface name :Real IP
Address /real port (Mapped IP Address /Mapped Port ) to egress interface name
:Real IP Address /Real Port (Mapped IP Address /Mapped Port )

Explanation

Stateful Failover failed to allocate a translation slot record.

Recommended Action

Check the available memory by using the show memory command to make sure that
the Secure Firewall ASA has free memory available. If no memory is available,
add more memory.

210008

Error Message

%ASA-3-210008: LU no xlate for inside_address /inside_port outside_address
/outside_port

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA cannot find a translation slot record for a Stateful
Failover connection; as a result, the Secure Firewall ASA cannot process the
connection information.

Recommended Action

Use the write standby command on the active unit to synchronize system memory
between the active and standby units.

210010

Error Message

%ASA-3-210010: LU make UDP connection for outside_address :outside_port
inside_address :inside_port failed

Explanation

Stateful Failover was unable to allocate a new record for a UDP connection.

Recommended Action

Check the available memory by using the show memory command to make sure that
the Secure Firewall ASA has free memory available. If no memory is available,
add more memory.

210020

Error Message

%ASA-3-210020: LU PAT port port reserve failed

Explanation

Stateful Failover is unable to allocate a specific PAT address that is in use.

Recommended Action

Use the write standby command on the active unit to synchronize system memory
between the active and standby units.

210021

Error Message

%ASA-3-210021: LU create static xlate global_address ifc interface_name failed

Explanation

Stateful Failover is unable to create a translation slot.

Recommended Action

Enter the write standby command on the active unit to synchronize system memory
between the active and standby units.

210022

Error Message

%ASA-6-210022: LU missed number updates

Explanation

Stateful Failover assigns a sequence number for each record sent to the standby
unit. When a received record sequence number is out of sequence with the last
updated record, the information in between is assumed to be lost, and this error
message is sent as a result.

Recommended Action

Unless LAN interruptions occur, check the available memory on both Secure
Firewall ASA units to ensure that enough memory is available to process the
stateful information. Use the show failover command to monitor the quality of
stateful information updates.

211001

Error Message

%ASA-3-211001: Memory allocation Error

212001

Error Message

%ASA-3-212001: Unable to open SNMP channel (UDP port port ) on interface
interface_number , error code = code

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA is unable to receive SNMP requests destined for the
Secure Firewall ASA from SNMP management stations located on this interface. The
SNMP traffic passing through the Secure Firewall ASA on any interface is not
affected. The error codes are as follows:
- An error code of -1 indicates that the Secure Firewall ASA cannot open the
SNMP transport for the interface. This can occur when the user attempts to
change the port on which SNMP accepts queries to one that is already in use by
another feature. In this case, the port used by SNMP will be reset to the
default port for incoming SNMP queries (UDP 161).
- An error code of -2 indicates that the Secure Firewall ASA cannot bind the
SNMP transport for the interface.

Recommended Action

After the Secure Firewall ASA reclaims some of its resources when traffic is
lighter, reenter the snmp-server host command for that interface.

212002

Error Message

%ASA-3-212002: Unable to open SNMP trap channel (UDP port port ) on interface
interface_number , error code = code

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA is unable to send its SNMP traps from the Secure
Firewall ASA to SNMP management stations located on this interface. The SNMP
traffic passing through the Secure Firewall ASA on any interface is not
affected. The error codes are as follows:
- An error code of -1 indicates that the Secure Firewall ASA cannot open the
SNMP trap transport for the interface.
- An error code of -2 indicates that the Secure Firewall ASA cannot bind the
SNMP trap transport for the interface.
- An error code of -3 indicates that the Secure Firewall ASA cannot set the trap
channel as write-only.

Recommended Action

After the Secure Firewall ASA reclaims some of its resources when traffic is
lighter, reenter the snmp-server host command for that interface.

212003

Error Message

%ASA-3-212003: Unable to receive an SNMP request on interface interface_number ,
error code = code , will try again.

Explanation

An internal error occurred in receiving an SNMP request destined for the Secure
Firewall ASA on the specified interface. The error codes are as follows:

Recommended Action

None required.

212005

Error Message

%ASA-3-212005: incoming SNMP request (number bytes) on interface interface_name
exceeds data buffer size, discarding this SNMP request.

Explanation

The length of the incoming SNMP request that is destined for the Secure Firewall
ASA exceeds the size of the internal data buffer (512 bytes) used for storing
the request during internal processing. The Secure Firewall ASA is unable to
process this request. The SNMP traffic passing through the Secure Firewall ASA
on any interface is not affected.

Recommended Action

Have the SNMP management station resend the request with a shorter length. For
example, instead of querying multiple MIB variables in one request, try querying
only one MIB variable in a request. You may need to modify the configuration of
the SNMP manager software.

212006

Error Message

%ASA-3-212006: Dropping SNMP request from src_addr /src_port to ifc :dst_addr
/dst_port because: reason username

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA cannot process the SNMP request being sent to it for the
following reasons:
- user not found - The username cannot be located in the local SNMP user
database.
- username exceeds maximum length - The username embedded in the PDU exceeds the
maximum length allowed by the SNMP RFCs.
- authentication algorithm failure - An authentication failure caused by an
invalid password or a packet authenticated using the incorrect algorithm.
- privacy algorithm failure - A privacy failure caused by an invalid password or
a packet encrypted using the incorrect algorithm.
- error decrypting request - An error occurred in the platform crypto module
decrypting the user request.
- error encrypting response - An error occurred in the platform crypto module
encrypting the user response or trap notification.
- engineBoots has reached maximum value - The engineBoots variable has reached
the maximum allowed value. For more information, see message 212011. 

Note The username appears after each reason listed. 

Recommended Action

Check the Secure Firewall ASA SNMP server settings and confirm that the NMS
configuration is using the expected user, authentication, and encryption
settings. Enter the show crypto accelerator statistics command to isolate errors
in the platform crypto module.

212009

Error Message

%ASA-5-212009: Configuration request for SNMP group groupname failed. User
username , reason .

Explanation

A user has tried to change the SNMP server group configuration. One or more
users that refer to the group have insufficient settings to comply with the
requested group changes.
- groupname - A string that represents the group name
- username - A string that represents the username
- reason - A string that represents one of the following reasons:
  - missing auth-password - A user has tried to add authentication to the group,
  and the user has not specified an authentication password
  - missing priv-password - A user has tried to add privacy to the group, and
  the user has not specified an encryption password
  - reference group intended for removal - A user has tried to remove a group
  that has users belonging to it

Recommended Action

The user must update the indicated user configurations before changing the group
or removing indicated users, and then add them again after making changes to the
group.

212010

Error Message

%ASA-3-212010: Configuration request for SNMP user %s failed. Host %s reason .

Explanation

A user has tried to change the SNMP server user configuration by removing one or
more hosts that reference the user. One message is generated per host.
- %s - A string that represents the username or hostname
- reason - A string the represents the following reason: 
  - references user intended for removal - The name of the user to be removed from
  the host.

Recommended Action

The user must either update the indicated host configuration before changing a
user or remove the indicated hosts, then add them again after making changes to
the user.

212011

Error Message

%ASA-3-212011: SNMP engineBoots is set to maximum value. Reason : %s User
intervention necessary.

Explanation

The device has rebooted 214783647 times, which is the maximum allowed value of
the engineBoots variable, or an error reading the persistent value from flash
memory has occurred. The engineBoots value is stored in flash memory in the
flash:/snmp/ctx-name file, where ctx-name is the name of the context. In single
mode, the name of this file is flash:/snmp/single_vf. In multi-mode, the name of
the file for the admin context is flash:/snmp/admin. During a reboot, if the
device is unable to read from the file or write to the file, the engineBoots
value is set to the maximum.
- %s - A string that represents the reason that the engineBoots value is set to
the maximum allowed value. The two valid strings are “device reboots” and “error
accessing persistent data.”

Recommended Action

For the first string, the administrator must delete all SNMP Version 3 users and
add them again to reset the engineBoots variable to 1. All subsequent Version 3
queries will fail until all users have been removed. For the second string, the
administrator must delete the context-specific file, then delete all SNMP
Version users, and add them again to reset the engineBoots variable to 1. All
subsequent Version 3 queries will fail until all users have been removed.

212012

Error Message

%ASA-3-212012: Unable to write SNMP engine data to persistent storage.

Explanation

The SNMP engine data is written to the file, flash:/snmp/context-name . For
example: in single mode, the data is written to the file, flash:/snmp/single_vf.
In the admin context in multi-mode, the file is written to the directory,
flash:/snmp/admin. The error may be caused by a failure to create the
flash:/snmp directory or the flash:/snmp/context-name file. The error may also
be caused by a failure to write to the file.

Recommended Action

The system administrator should remove the flash:/snmp/context-name file, then
remove all SNMP Version 3 users, and add them again. This procedure should
recreate the flash:/snmp/context-name file. If the problem persists, the system
administrator should try reformatting the flash.

Interpreter to resolve the problem. If the problem persists, contact the Cisco
TAC.

216002

Error Message

%ASA-3-216002: Unexpected event (major: major_id , minor: minor_id ) received by
task_string in function at line: line_num  

Explanation

A task registers for event notification, but the task cannot handle the specific
event. Events that can be watched include those associated with queues,
booleans, and timer services. If any of the registered events occur, the
scheduler wakes up the task to process the event. This message is generated if
an unexpected event woke up the task, but it does not know how to handle the
event.
If an event is left unprocessed, it can wake up the task very often to make sure
that it is processed, but this should not occur under normal conditions. If this
message appears, it does not necessarily mean the device is unusable, but
something unusual has occurred and needs to be investigated.
- major_id - Event identifier
- minor_id - Event identifier
- task_string - Custom string passed by the task to identify itself
- function - The function that received the unexpected event
- line_num - Line number in the code

Recommended Action

If the problem persists, contact the Cisco TAC.

216003

Error Message

%ASA-3-216003: Unrecognized timer timer_ptr , timer_id received by task_string
in function at line: line_num

Explanation

An unexpected timer event woke up the task, but the task does not know how to
handle the event. A task can register a set of timer services with the
scheduler. If any of the timers expire, the scheduler wakes up the task to take
action. This message is generated if the task is awakened by an unrecognized
timer event.
An expired timer, if left unprocessed, wakes up the task continuously to make
sure that it is processed, and this is undesirable. This should not occur under
normal conditions. If this message appears, it does not necessarily mean the
device is unusable, but something unusual has occurred and needs to be
investigated.
- timer_ptr - Pointer to the timer
- timer_id - Timer identifier
- task_string - Custom string passed by the task to identify itself
- function - The function that received the unexpected event
- line_num - Line number in the code

Recommended Action

If the problem persists, contact the Cisco TAC.

216004

Error Message

%ASA-4-216004:prevented: error in function at file (line ) - stack trace

Explanation

An internal logic error has occurred, which should not occur during normal
operation.
- error - Internal logic error. Possible errors include the
following:
  - Exception
  - Dereferencing null pointer
  - Array index out of bounds
  - Invalid buffer size
  - Writing from input 
  - Source and destination overlap
  - Invalid date
  - Access offset from array indices
- function - The calling function that generated the error
- file(line) - The file and line number that generated the error
- stack trace - Full call stack traceback, starting with the calling function.
For example: (“0x001010a4 0x00304e58 0x00670060 0x00130b04”)

Recommended Action

If the problem persists, contact the Cisco TAC.

216005

Error Message

%ASA-1-216005: ERROR: Duplex-mismatch on interface_name resulted in transmitter
lockup. A soft reset of the switch was performed.

Explanation

A duplex mismatch on the port caused a problem in which the port can no longer
transmit packets. This condition was detected, and the switch was reset to
autorecover. This message applies only to the ASA 5505.
- interface_name - The interface name that was locked up

Recommended Action

A duplex mismatch exists between the specified port and the ASA 5505 that is
connected to it. Correct the duplex mismatch by either setting both devices to
autorecover, or hard coding the duplex mismatch for both devices to be the same.

218001

Error Message

%ASA-2-218001: Failed Identification Test in slot# [fail #/res ].

Explanation

The module in slot# of the Secure Firewall ASA cannot be identified as a genuine
Cisco product. Cisco warranties and support programs apply only to genuine Cisco
products. If Cisco determines that the cause of a support issue is related to
non-Cisco memory, SSM modules, SSC modules, or other modules, Cisco may deny
support under your warranty or under a Cisco support program such as SmartNet.

Recommended Action

If this message recurs, copy it exactly as it appears on the console or in the
system log. Research and try to resolve the error using the Output Interpreter.
Also perform a search with the Bug Toolkit. If the problem persists, contact the
Cisco TAC.

218002

Error Message

%ASA-2-218002: Module (slot# ) is a registered proto-type for Cisco Lab use
only, and not certified for live network operation.

Explanation

The hardware in the specified location is a prototype module that came from a
Cisco lab.

Recommended Action

If this message reoccurs, copy it exactly as it appears on the console or in the
system log. Research and try to resolve the error using the Output Interpreter.
Also perform a search with the Bug Toolkit. If the problem persists, contact the
Cisco TAC.

218003

Error Message

%ASA-2-218003: Module Version in slot# is obsolete. The module in slot = slot#
is obsolete and must be returned via RMA to Cisco Manufacturing. If it is a lab
unit, it must be returned to Proto Services for upgrade.

Explanation

Obsolete hardware has been detected or the show module command has been run for
the module. This message is generated once per minute after it first appears.

Recommended Action

If this message recurs, copy it exactly as it appears on the console or in the
system log. Research and try to resolve the error using the Output Interpreter.
Also perform a search with the Bug Toolkit. If the problem persists, contact the
Cisco TAC.

218004

Error Message

%ASA-2-218004: Failed Identification Test in slot# [fail# /res ]

Explanation

A problem occurred while identifying hardware in the specified location.

Recommended Action

If this message recurs, copy it exactly as it appears on the console or in the
system log. Research and try to resolve the error using the Output Interpreter.
Also perform a search with the Bug Toolkit. If the problem persists, contact the
Cisco TAC.

218005

Error Message

%ASA-2-218005: Inconsistency detected in the system information programmed in
non-volatile memory

Explanation

System information programmed in non-volatile memory is not consistent. This
syslog will be generated during bootup if Secure Firewall ASA detects that the
contents of the IDPROM are not identical to the contents of ACT2 EEPROM. Since
the IDPROM and ACT2 EEPROM are programmed with exactly the same contents in
manufacturing, this would happen either due to an error in manufacturing or if
the IDPROM contents are tampered with.

Recommended Action

If the message recurs, collect the output of the show tech-support command and
contact Cisco TAC.

219002

Error Message

%ASA-3-219002: I2C_API_name error, slot = slot_number , device = device_number ,
address = address , byte count = count . Reason: reason_string

Explanation

The I2C serial bus API has failed because of a hardware or software problem.
- I2C_API_name - The I2C API that failed, which can be one of the following:
  - I2C_read_byte_w_wait()
  - I2C_read_word_w_wait()
  - I2C_read_block_w_wait()
  - I2C_write_byte_w_wait()
  - I2C_write_word_w_wait()
  - I2C_write_block_w_wait()
  - I2C_read_byte_w_suspend() 
  - I2C_read_word_w_suspend()
  - I2C_read_block_w_suspend()
  - I2C_write_byte_w_suspend()
  - I2C_write_word_w_suspend()
  - I2C_write_block_w_suspend()
- slot_number - The hexadecimal number of the slot where the I/O operation that
generated the message occurred. The slot number cannot be unique to a slot in
the chassis. Depending on the chassis, two different slots might have the same
I2C slot number. Also, the value is not necessarily less than or equal to the
number of slots. The value depends on the way the I2C hardware is wired.
- device_number - The hexadecimal number of the device on the slot for which the
I/O operation was performed
- address - The hexadecimal address of the device on which the I/O operation
occurred
- byte_count - The byte count in decimal format of the I/O operation
- error_string - The reason for the error, which can be one of the following:
  - I2C_BUS_TRANSACTION_ERROR
  - I2C_CHKSUM_ERROR
  - I2C_TIMEOUT_ERROR
  - I2C_BUS_COLLISION_ERROR
  - I2C_HOST_BUSY_ERROR
  - I2C_UNPOPULATED_ERROR
  - I2C_SMBUS_UNSUPPORT
  - I2C_BYTE_COUNT_ERROR
  - I2C_DATA_PTR_ERROR 

Recommended Action

Perform the following steps:
1. Log and review the messages and the errors associated with the event. If the
message does not occur continuously and disappears after a few minutes, it might
be because the I2C serial bus is busy.
2. Reboot the software running on the Secure Firewall ASA.
3. Power cycle the device. When you turn off the power, make sure that you wait
several seconds before turning the power on.
4. If the problem persists, contact the Cisco TAC.
