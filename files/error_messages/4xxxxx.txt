402114

Error Message

%ASA-4-402114: IPSEC: Received an protocol packet (SPI=spi , sequence
number=seq_num ) from remote_IP to local_IP with an invalid SPI.

Explanation

An IPsec packet was received that specifies an SPI that does not exist in the SA
database. This may be a temporary condition caused by slight differences in
aging of SAs between the IPsec peers, or it may be because the local SAs have
been cleared. It may also indicate incorrect packets sent by the IPsec peer,
which may be part of an attack. This message is rate limited to no more than one
message every five seconds.
- protocol - IPsec protocol
- spi - IPsec Security Parameter Index
- seq_num - IPsec sequence number
- remote_IP - IP address of the remote endpoint of the tunnel

402117

Error Message

%ASA-4-402117: IPSEC: Received a non-IPsec (protocol ) packet from remote_IP to
local_IP .

Explanation

The received packet matched the crypto map ACL, but it is not
IPsec-encapsulated. The IPsec peer is sending unencapsulated packets. This error
can occur because of a policy setup error on the peer. For example, the firewall
may be configured to only accept encrypted Telnet traffic to the outside
interface port 23. If you attempt to use Telnet without IPsec encryption to
access the outside interface on port 23, this message appears, but not with
Telnet or traffic to the outside interface on ports other than 23. This error
can also indicate an attack. This message is not generated except under these
conditions (for example, it is not generated for traffic to the Secure Firewall
ASA interfaces themselves). See messages 710001, 710002, and 710003, which track
TCP and UDP requests. This message is rate limited to no more than one message
every five seconds.

general, the configuration should specify a dialing policy, the PPP
authentication, the username, and a password. The following example configures
the Secure Firewall ASA for PPPoE dialout. The my-username and my-password
commands are used to authenticate the access concentrator, using PAP if
necessary. For example:
ciscoasa# vpdn group my-pppoe request dialout pppoe
ciscoasa# vpdn group my-pppoe ppp authentication pap
ciscoasa# vpdn group my-pppoe localname my-username
ciscoasa# vpdn username my-username password my-password

configure the PPPoE on an interface other than the failover interface.

403507

Error Message

%ASA-3-403507: PPPoE:PPPoE client on interface interface failed to locate PPPoE
vpdn group group_name

Explanation

You can configure the PPPoE client on an interface to use a particular VPDN
group by entering the pppoe client vpdn group group_name command. If a PPPoE
VPDN group of the configured name was not located during system startup, this
message is generated.
- interface - The interface on which the PPPoE client failed
- group_name - The VPDN group name of the PPPoe client on the interface

Recommended Action

Perform the following steps:
1. Add the required VPDN group by entering the vpdn group group_name command.
Request dialout PPPoE in global configuration mode, and add all the group
properties.
2. Remove the pppoe client vpdn group group_name command from the interface
indicated. In this case, the PPPoE client will attempt to use the first PPPoE
VPDN group defined.
Note: All changes take effect only after the PPPoE client on the interface is
restarted by entering the ip address pppoe command.

Error Message

%ASA-4-405001: Received ARP {request | response} collision from IP_address
/MAC_address on interface interface_name with existing ARP entry IP_address
/MAC_address

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA received an ARP packet, and the MAC address in the
packet differs from the ARP cache entry.

Recommended Action

This traffic might be legitimate, or it might indicate that an ARP poisoning
attack is in progress. Check the source MAC address to determine where the
packets are coming from and to see if they belong to a valid host.

405002

Error Message

%ASA-4-405002: Received mac mismatch collision from IP_address /MAC_address for
authenticated host

Explanation

This packet appears for one of the following conditions:
- The Secure Firewall ASA received a packet with the same IP address, but a
different MAC address from one of its uauth entries.
- You configured the vpnclient mac-exempt command on the Secure Firewall ASA,
and the Secure Firewall ASA received a packet with an exempt MAC address, but a
different IP address from the corresponding uauth entry.

Recommended Action

This traffic might be legitimate, or it might indicate that a spoofing attack is
in progress. Check the source MAC address and IP address to determine where the
packets are coming from and if they belong to a valid host.

405003

Error Message

memory usage, or purchase additional memory. If this message occurs
periodically, it can be ignored. If the problem persists, contact the Cisco TAC.

405103

Error Message

%ASA-4-405103: H225 message from source_address/source_port to dest_address
/dest_port contains bad protocol discriminator hex

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA is expecting the protocol discriminator, 0x08, but it
received something other than 0x08. The endpoint may be sending a bad packet, or
received a message segment other than the first segment. The packet is allowed
through.

Recommended Action

None required.

405104

Error Message

%ASA-4-405104: H225 message received from outside_address /outside_port to
inside_address /inside_port before SETUP

Explanation

An H.225 message was received out of order, before the initial SETUP message,
which is not allowed. The Secure Firewall ASA must receive an initial SETUP
message for that H.225 call signalling channel before accepting any other H.225
messages.

Recommended Action

None required.

405105

Error Message

%ASA-4-405105: H323 RAS message AdmissionConfirm received from source_address
/source_port to dest_address /dest_port without an AdmissionRequest

Explanation

A gatekeeper has sent an ACF, but the Secure Firewall ASA did not send an ARQ to
the gatekeeper.

Recommended Action

Check the gatekeeper with the specified source_address to determine why it sent
an ACF without receiving an ARQ from the Secure Firewall ASA.

405106

Error Message

%ASA-4-405106: H323 num channel is not created from %I/%d to %I/%d %s

Explanation

The ASA tried to create a match condition on the H.323 media-type channel. See
the match media-type command for more information.

Recommended Action

None required.

405107

Error Message

%ASA-4-405107: H245 Tunnel is detected and connection dropped from %I/%d to

405201

Error Message

%ASA-4-405201: ILS ILS_message_type from inside_interface:source_IP_address to
outside_interface:/destination_IP_address has wrong embedded address
embedded_IP_address

Explanation

The embedded address in the ILS packet payload was not the same as the source IP
address of the IP packet header.

Recommended Action

Check the host specified with the source_IP_address to determine why it sent an
ILS packet with an incorrect embedded IP address.

405300

Error Message

%ASA-4-405300: Radius Accounting Request received from from_addr is not allowed

Explanation

The accounting request came from a host that was not configured in the policy
map. The message is logged and processing stops.
- from_addr - The IP address of the host sending the request

Recommended Action

If the host was configured to send RADIUS accounting messages to the ASA, make
sure that it was configured in the correct policy map that was applied to the
service policy. If the host was not configured to send RADIUS accounting
messages to the ASA, then check to see why the messages are being sent. If the
messages are illegitimate, then create the proper ACLs to drop the packets.

405301

Error Message

%ASA-4-405301: Attribute attribute_number does not match for user user_ip

Explanation

When the validate-attribute command was entered, the attribute values stored in
the accounting request start received do not match those stored in the entry, if
it exists.
- attribute_number - The RADIUS attribute to be validated with RADIUS
accounting. Values range from 1 to 191. Vendor-specific attributes are not
supported.
- user_ip - The IP address (framed IP attribute) of the user.

Recommended Action

None required.

406001

Error Message

%ASA-4-406001: FTP port command low port: IP_address /port to IP_address on
interface interface_name

Explanation

A client entered an FTP port command and supplied a port less than 1024 (in the
well-known port range usually devoted to server ports). This is indicative of an
attempt to avert the site security policy. The Secure Firewall ASA drops the
packet, terminates the connection, and logs the event.

Recommended Action

None required.

406002

Error Message

%ASA-4-406002: FTP port command different address: IP_address(IP_address ) to
IP_address on interface interface_name

Explanation

A client entered an FTP port command and supplied an address other than the
address used in the connection. An attempt to avert the site security policy
occurred. For example, an attacker might attempt to hijack an FTP session by
changing the packet on the way, and putting different source information instead
of the correct source information. The Secure Firewall ASA drops the packet,
terminates the connection, and logs the event. The address in parentheses is the
address from the port command.

Recommended Action

None required.

407001

Error Message

%ASA-4-407001: Deny traffic for local-host interface_name :inside_address ,
license limit of number exceeded

Explanation

The host limit was exceeded. An inside host is counted toward the limit when one
of the following conditions is true:
- The inside host has forwarded traffic through the Secure Firewall ASA within
the last five minutes.
- The inside host has reserved an xlate connection or user authentication at the
Secure Firewall ASA.

Recommended Action

The host limit is enforced on the low-end platforms. Use the show version
command to view the host limit. Use the show local-host command to view the
current active hosts and the inside users that have sessions at the Secure
Firewall ASA. To forcefully disconnect one or more users, use the clear
local-host command. To expire the inside users more quickly from the limit, set
the xlate, connection, and uauth timeouts to the recommended values or lower as
given in the table below:
Table 46: Timeouts and Recommended Values
Timeout     Recommended Value
-----------------------------------
xlate       00:05:00 (five minutes)
-----------------------------------
conn        00:01:00 (one hour)
-----------------------------------
uauth       00:05:00 (five minutes)

407002

Error Message

%ASA-4-407002: Embryonic limit nconns /elimit for through connections
exceeded.outside_address /outside_port to global_address (inside_address
)/inside_port on interface interface_name

Explanation

The number of connections from a specified foreign address over a specified
global address to the specified local address exceeded the maximum embryonic
limit for that static. The Secure Firewall ASA tries to accept the connection if
it can allocate memory for that connection. It proxies on behalf of the local
host and sends a SYN_ACK packet to the foreign host. The Secure Firewall ASA
retains pertinent state information, drops the packet, and waits for the
acknowledgment from the client. The message might indicate legitimate traffic or
that a DoS attack is in progress.

Recommended Action

Check the source address to determine where the packets are coming from and
whether or not a valid host is sending them.

407003

Error Message

%ASA-4-407003: Established limit for RPC services exceeded number

Explanation

The Secure Firewall ASA tried to open a new hole for a pair of RPC servers or
services that have already been configured after the maximum number of holes has
been met.

Recommended Action

Wait for other holes to be closed (through associated timeout expiration), or
limit the number of active pairs of servers or services.

408001

Error Message

%ASA-4-408001: IP route counter negative - reason , IP_address Attempt: number

Explanation

An attempt to decrement the IP route counter into a negative value failed.

Recommended Action

Enter the clear ip route command to reset the route counter. If the problem
persists, contact the Cisco TAC.

408002

Error Message

%ASA-4-408002: ospf process id route type update address1 netmask1
[distance1/metric1 ] via source IP :interface1 address2 netmask2 [distance2
/metric2 ] interface2

Explanation

A network update was received from a different interface with the same distance
and a better metric than the existing route. The new route overrides the
existing route that was installed through another interface. The new route is
for redundancy purposes only and means that a path has shifted in the network.
This change must be controlled through topology and redistribution. Any existing
connections affected by this change are probably disabled and will time out.
This path shift only occurs if the network topology has been specifically
designed to support path redundancy, in which case it is expected.

Recommended Action

None required.

408003

Error Message

%ASA-4-408003: can't track this type of object hex

Explanation

412001

Error Message

%ASA-4-412001:MAC MAC_address moved from interface_1 to interface_2

Explanation

A host move was detected from one module interface to another. In a transparent
Secure Firewall ASA, mapping between the host (MAC) and Secure Firewall ASA port
is maintained in a Layer 2 forwarding table. The table dynamically binds packet
source MAC addresses to an Secure Firewall ASA port. In this process, whenever
movement of a host from one interface to another interface is detected, this
message is generated.

Recommended Action

The host move might be valid or might be an attempt to spoof host MACs on other
interfaces. If it is a MAC spoof attempt, you can either locate vulnerable hosts
on your network and remove them or configure static MAC entries, which will not
allow MAC address and port binding to change. If it is a genuine host move, no
action is required.

412002

Error Message

%ASA-4-412002:Detected bridge table full while inserting MAC MAC_address on
interface interface . Number of entries = num

Explanation

The bridge table was full and an attempt was made to add one more entry. The
Secure Firewall ASA maintains a separate Layer 2 forwarding table per context
and the message is generated whenever a context exceeds its size limit. The MAC
address will be added, but it will replace the oldest existing dynamic entry (if
available) in the table. This might be an attempted attack.

Recommended Action

Make sure that the new bridge table entries are valid. In case of attack, use
EtherType ACLs to control access to vulnerable hosts.

%ASA-4-446001: Maximum TLS Proxy session limit of max_sess reached.

Explanation

A configured maximum session limit for TLS proxy was reached. New sessions
beyond the limit were denied.
- max_sess - The currently effective maximum session limit

Recommended Action

If more TLS sessions are needed, use the tls-proxy maximum-sessions max_sess
command to increase the limit. Alternatively, you can use the tls-proxy
proxy_name and tls-proxy maximum-sessions max_sess commands, and then reboot for
the commands to take effect.

446003

Error Message

%ASA-4-446003: Denied TLS Proxy session from src_int :src_ip /src_port to
dst_int :dst_ip /dst_port , UC-IME license is disabled.

Explanation

The UC-IME license is either on or off. Once enabled, UC-IME can use any number
of available TLS sessions, according to the Secure Firewall ASA limit and the K8
export limit.
- src_int - The source interface name (inside or outside)
- src_ip - The source IP address
- src_port - The source port
- dst_int - The destination interface name (inside or outside)
- dst_ip - The destination IP address
- dst_port - The destination port

447001

Error Message

%ASA-4-447001: ASP DP to CP queue_name was full. Queue length length , limit
limit

Explanation

This message indicates a particular data path (DP) to control point (CP) event
queue is full, and one or more multiple enqueue actions have failed. If the
event contains a packet block, such as for CP application inspection, the packet
will be dropped by the DP, and a counter from the show asp drop command will
increment. If the event is for punt to CP, a typical counter is the Punt no
memory ASP-drop counter.
- queue - The name of the DP-CP event queue.
- length - The current number of events on the queue.
- limit - The maximum number of events that are allowed on the queue.

Recommended Action

The queue-full condition reflects the fact that the load on the CP has exceeded
the CP processing ability, which may or may not be a temporary condition. You
should consider reducing the feature load on the CP if this message appears
repeatedly. Use the show asp event dp-cp command to identify the features that
contribute the most load on the event queue.

448001

Error Message

%ASA-4-448001: Denied SRTP crypto session setup on flow from src_int :src_ip
/src_port to dst_int :dst_ip /dst_port , licensed K8 SRTP crypto session of
limit exceeded

Explanation

For a K8 platform, the limit of 250 SRTP crypto sessions is enforced. Each pair
of SRTP encrypt or decrypt sessions is counted as one SRTP crypto session. A
call is counted toward this limit only when encryption or decryption is required
for a medium, which means that if the pass-through is set for the call, even if
both legs use SRTP, they are not counted toward this limit.
- src_int - The source interface name (inside or outside)
- src_ip - The source IP address
- src_port - The source port
- dst_int - The destination interface name (inside or outside)
- dst_ip - The destination IP address
- dst_port - The destination port
- limit - The K8 limit of SRTP crypto sessions (250)

Recommended Action

None required. You can set up new SRTP crypto sessions only when existing SRTP
crypto sessions have been released.

only.
- protocol_id - The protocol ID number
- interface_name - The interface associated with the sender or receiver of the
packet
- IP_address - The IP address of the sender/receiver of the packet
