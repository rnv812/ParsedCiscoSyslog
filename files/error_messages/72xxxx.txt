information about memory usage, network topology, and the conditions during
which this message is received. Send this information to the Cisco TAC for
review. Make sure that the WebVPN session is still up while this message is
being received. If not, determine the reason that the WebVPN session is down. If
the Secure Firewall ASA is under heavy load, upgrade the Secure Firewall ASA,
add memory, or reduce the load. If the problem persists, contact the Cisco TAC.

initiated the connection
- interface - The interface name that the SSL session is using
- source-ip - The source IPv4 or IPv6 address

725014

Error Message

%ASA-7-725014 SSL lib error. Function: function Reason: reason

Explanation

The reason for failure of the SSL handshake is indicated.
- function - The function name where the failure is reported
- reason - The description of the failure condition

Recommended Action

Include this message when reporting any SSL-related issue to the Cisco TAC.

725015

Error Message

%ASA-3-725015 Error verifying client certificate. Public key size in client
certificate exceeds the maximum supported key size.

Explanation

The verification of an SSL client certificate failed because of an unsupported
(large) key size.

Recommended Action

Use client certificates with key sizes that are less than or equal to 4096 bits.

725016

Error Message

%ASA-6-725016: Device selects trust-point trustpoint for peer-type interface
:src-ip /src-port to dst-ip /dst-port

Explanation

With server-name indication (SNI), the certificate used for a given connection
may not be the certificate configured on the interface. There is also no
indication of which certificate trustpoint has been selected. This syslog gives
an indication of the trustpoint used by the connection (given by interface
:src-ip /src-port ).
- trustpoint - The name of the configured trustpoint that is being used for the
specified connection
- interface - The name of the interface on the Secure Firewall ASA
- src-ip - The IP address of the peer
- src-port - The port number of the peer
- dst-ip - The IP address of the destination
- dst-port - The port number of the destination

Recommended Action

None required.

725017

Error Message

%ASA-7-725017: No certificates received during the handshake with %s %s :%B /%d
to %B /%d for %s session

Explanation

A remote client has not sent a valid certificate.
- remote_device - Identifies whether a handshake is performed with the client or server
- ctm-interface - The interface name on which the handshake is sent
- ctm-src_ip - The IP address of the SSL server, which will communicate with the client
- ctm-src_port - The port of the SSL server, which will communicate with the client
- ctm-dst_ip - The IP address of the client
- ctm-dst_port - The port of the client through which it responds
- s-method-version - The protocol version involved in the transaction (SSLv3,
TLSv1, or DTLSv1)

Recommended Action

None required.

725021

Error Message

%ASA-7-725021: Device preferring cipher-suite cipher(s). Connection info:
interface :src-ip /src-port to dst-ip /dst-port

Explanation

The cipher suites being preferred when negotiating the handshake is listed in
this message.
- cipher-suite - Preferred cipher suite string
- interface - The interface name that the SSL session is using
- src-ip - The source IPv4 or IPv6 address
- src-port - The source port number
- dst-ip - The destination IPv4 or IPv6 address
- dst-port - The destination port number
Following is a list of prefered cipher suite strings that are used when
negotiating the handshake:
- server
- SUITE-B
- ChaCha20
- client
- SHA-256 hash

Recommended Action

None required.

725022

Error Message

%ASA-7-725022: Device skipping cipher : cipher - reason. Connection info:
interface :src-ip /src-port to dst-ip /dst-port

Explanation

This syslog displays the reason for skipping a particular cipher in a list of
cipher suites when negotiating the handshake.
- cipher-suite - Preferred cipher suite string
- reason - Reason for skipping a cipher.
- interface - The interface name that the SSL session is using
- src-ip - The source IPv4 or IPv6 address
- src-port - The source port number
- dst-ip - The destination IPv4 or IPv6 address
- dst-port - The destination port number
Following list provides few example reason for skipping a particular cipher:
- Ephemeral EC key is not compatible with trust-point <trust point>
- Not supported by protocol version
- PSK server callback is not set
- Not permitted by security callbacks
- ECDHE-ECDSA is broken on Safari
- Cipher suite does not use SHA256
- Unknown cipher
- Wrong cipher
- Message digest changed
- Ciphersuite from previous session not selected

Recommended Action

None required.
